Hepatitis A Overview
Resources: Hepatitis A Symptoms | Hepatitis A Testing
What Is Hepatitis?
Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that can complicate how well the liver functions. This inflammation can occur due to heavy alcohol use, exposure to certain toxins, some medications, and certain medical conditions, such as viral infections hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E.
Take Charge of Your Health
Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can be easily spread from sexual activities, consuming contaminated food/drinks, or from improper hand washing. If you think you may have been exposed, order our fast & affordable Hepatitis A test.
or call 1-800-456-2323 or start a Live Chat
What Is Hepatitis A?
What is Hep A? Hepatitis A (HAV) is a contagious, acute (sudden and severe at the start) liver disease that, unlike hepatitis B and C, does not become chronic (gradually developing serious, long-term complications). Hepatitis A is a virus, and its infections can be mild and last a few weeks, or severe and last several months. People with hepatitis A are typically cured of the virus without treatment and often only need proper rest and fluid intake.
Adults can experience symptoms including but not limited to:
Fatigue
Jaundice
Stomach pain
Nausea
Low appetite
How Common Is Hepatitis A?
The most common hepatitis viruses in the U.S. are hepatitis A, B, and C. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), since 1995, rates have declined by more than 95% thanks to the vaccine becoming available.1 In 2016, there were only an estimated 4,000 hepatitis A cases in the U.S.
Most types of hepatitis, especially hepatitis A, are much more common in developing countries.
How Serious Is Hep A?
Most people with Hepatitis A will feel sick for several weeks but fortunately, it is normal to recover without permanent or lasting liver damage. It is not a disease that commonly becomes a chronic liver disease. However, while it is pretty rare, there have been cases reported where hepatitis A caused liver failure and even death. This happens more often in people beyond the age of 50 and in those with other liver conditions.
Causes  
Hepatitis A Causes
Hepatitis is found in the blood and stool of infected persons. It’s super contagious. You can unknowingly ingest the virus, even in small microscopic quantities. It can occur from sexually activity or eating food containing the infection. The infection can happen at any point of processing food. Like, during the growth or harvesting stages and even during the sorting and shipment phases. Even after cooking food thoroughly, it can still be present. 
How Is Hepatitis A Transmitted? 
How is Hep A transmitted? Hepatitis A can be contracted or spread when an unvaccinated person eats or drinks infected fecal matter through objects, food, or drinks that carry the virus—even in microscopic amounts. Eating or drinking contaminated food or water is the most common way of contracting hepatitis A.
How do you get Hep A? Is Hepatitis A an STD? Hep A can also be transmitted sexually whenever partners’ sexual fluids mix with infected fecal matter. The most common way to acquire hepatitis A sexually is through oral-anal contact with someone carrying the virus due to the chances of ingesting fecal matter. Symptoms are often mild or not apparent, and a person can transmit the virus to others up to two weeks before symptoms even appear.
A few other ways detailing how hepatitis A is transmitted include:
Close personal contact with infected persons who have poor hygiene
Sharing intravenous illegal drugs with an infected person
Anal sex
Is Hepatitis A Contagious?
Yes, it is. You are most contagious shortly after you acquire HAV, even if symptoms haven’t appeared yet. Once symptoms do begin to appear, after two weeks, you are no longer contagious. However, those with weak immune systems may be contagious for up to six months.
Is Hepatitis A Sexually Transmitted?
Is Hep A an STD? How is Hep A spread? Hepatitis A virus can be transmitted through any sexual activity that is with someone who has the infection. This also goes for what is called a “brown shower” in the BDSM world. A “brown shower” is when the excrement of someone is emptied into the mouth of another person. Similar to a “golden shower”, which refers to urine instead of feces.
Can I Get it Again?
No, if you have been infected with hepatitis A in the past, your body has developed antibodies to the hepatitis A virus, therefore you cannot get it again.
Risk factors
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), hepatitis A transmission is decreasing in the United States. Getting tested is especially important if you have traveled or lived in locations such as Eastern Europe, Africa, Mexico, Central or South America, or certain parts of Asia where hepatitis A is prevalent.
Those at a higher risk of acquiring HAV may include those who:
Live in areas that have a lack of safe water
Live in a household with an infected person
Have poor sanitation/hygiene
Are sexually active but are not vaccinated
Participate in anal sex or oral-anal contact
Travel to areas of high endemicity without being vaccinated
Work with nonhuman primates
Hepatitis A Prevention
Vaccines
The best method for preventing hepatitis A is to get vaccinated as it is highly effective at preventing infection as well as providing long-term protection. The CDC recommends getting a shot of immune globulin (Ig) before traveling, or if you are at a high risk of contracting the virus. Hepatitis vaccines are considered highly effective and safe.
The following people are recommended a hepatitis A vaccination:
All children when they reach 1 year old
Travelers to countries where hepatitis A is prevalent
Family/caregivers of adoptees from countries where hepatitis A is common
Those who participate in anal sex
Users of recreational drugs, whether injected or not
People who live in unsanitary conditions or experiencing homelessness
People with chronic or long-term liver disease, including HBV or HCV
People with clotting factor disorders
People with direct contact with others who have hepatitis A
Any person wishing to obtain immunity against the virus
What is Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)?
In the case of hepatitis A, PEP works as an injection of either the hepatitis A vaccine or immune globulin. Postexposure prophylaxis simply means to attempt at blocking or treating a disease after exposure. If you have ever been exposed to someone or you went through a scenario that had a high-risk factor of acquiring hepatitis A, PEP is an option at your disposal. However, PEP is only effective in preventing hepatitis A if given within the first 2 weeks after exposure.
Other Ways to Avoid Hepatitis A
Thoroughly washing your hands with soap and hot water after coming into contact with fecal matter is key to avoiding the hepatitis A virus.
The good news is, once you have had the hepatitis A virus, you cannot get it again since your body has built up antibodies against it.

HIV Antibody Test - FDA-Approved HIV AntiBody Diagnosis | STD Check

HIV 1 & 2 Antibody (4th Gen) Test
FDA-Approved HIV Antibody Test
 - Our standard HIV test is the HIV 4th Generation Duo Antigen/Antibody Test. This FDA-approved 4th generation HIV test evaluates the blood for HIV Type 1 and Type 2 in two ways: By detecting antibodies that your immune system creates specifically to fight the HIV virus, as well as detecting Human Immunodeficiency Virus antigens called HIV P24 antigens. These antigens are viral proteins that make up most of the core of the virus; they are especially helpful in diagnosing HIV because these antigen levels P24 antigens are high in the first few weeks after infection. Since this test is sensitive to P24 antigens, it is useful for diagnosing HIV infections when antibody levels are still initially low. If your initial blood test result is positive, a confirmation test will be completed on the same blood sample to confirm the diagnosis at no additional cost. Getting tested for HIV is essential– It is possible to have HIV and infect your partner without showing any signs or symptoms of having the virus.

HIV 4th Generation Test
How accurate is the HIV 4th Generation test?
All laboratory testing, including STD tests, have accuracy rates that are measured in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Our FDA-approved HIV 4th Generation Antibody/Antigen test has a sensitivity rate of 100% and a specificity of 99.72-100%.
What is the Testing Window for HIV?
HIV has an incubation period of 21 days, and since the HIV 4th Generation Test looks for antigens and antibodies produced in the weeks following exposure, it can be taken 3 weeks from the latest encounter.
Does the HIV 4th Generation Test use a blood or urine sample?
Our HIV 4th Generation Antibody/Antigen test requires a small blood sample. There is no undressing or uncomfortable swabbing.
Do I need to prepare for the test?
No fasting or additional preparation is needed for the HIV 4th Generation Antibody/Antigen test.
Can HIV be cured or treated?
There is no cure for HIV, but with the help of various anti-retroviral drugs, HIV can be managed and individuals with HIV can lead normal lives. The medications prescribed to treat and manage HIV strengthen the immune system and help prevent HIV from developing into AIDS.
When is the right time to take the HIV 4th Generation test?
The right time to take our 4th Generation HIV Antibody/Antigen Test is 3 weeks post-exposure. This blood test searches for the presence of HIV antibodies in the blood, as well as antigens on the surface of HIV cells. Most people will develop detectable antibodies (proteins made by the immune system to fight HIV) within this time frame, but in rare cases it may take up to 3 months for them to develop, making this test conclusive at 100% accuracy if taken 12 weeks post-exposure. This test is sensitive to P24 antigens, so it is useful for diagnosing HIV infections when antibody levels are still initially low. If antibodies or antigens to HIV are found, a supplemental differentiation assay is performed at no additional cost to confirm the presence of HIV RNA. If you are concerned about recent exposure, our HIV RNA Early Detection Test can detect the presence of HIV as early as 9-11 days after exposure.
How long do results for the HIV 4th Generation test take and what could the results say?
It takes 1 - 2 business days for the results of your HIV 4th Generation Antibody/Antigen test to come back. The report will either say "Detected" or "Not Detected". If there are no signs of HIV antibodies or antigens in the blood, the result is negative (Not Detected). If HIV antibodies or antigens were found in your blood sample, the result will read "Detected" and the confirmation test will be performed to confirm that result.
HIV 4th Generation Antibody/Antigen test
Who needs HIV 4th Generation Antibody/Antigen testing?
HIV affects both men and women. Anyone who has had unprotected sex or who engages in intravenous drug use should get tested. It is possible to have HIV for a long time without being aware, especially because its symptoms (if present) could be mistaken for other illnesses. The only way to know is to get tested. The HIV test should be a part of your routine STD screening.
When is the Right Time to Test For HIV?
Now is the best time to test for HIV. Know your HIV and STD status today.
If you had a recent unprotected sexual encounter with someone whose STD status you do not know or who uses intravenous drugs, it is important that you get tested for HIV and other STDs today. Most people will develop detectable antibodies as soon as 3 weeks after exposure, but in rare cases, it may take up to 3 months.

Your only job is to answer questions that visitors may have prior to placing an order and getting tested for STDs. Before you communicate with a visitor, understand that are not permitted to help visitors if they have already placed an order. The most important rule of your job is that you are not permitted to ask visitors for their name, email, or order number. If a visitor has already tested and is inquiring on results, ask them to call in.

You must always follow these rules:
Never let the visitor know you are an AI. Always identify yourself to the visitor as Suzy, a live chat representative for STDcheck.com.
Your job is to only help prospective customers make a decision to buy.

Never ask the visitor for their personally indentifying information.
Never ask the visitor for their name.
Never ask the visitor for their email.
Never ask the visitor for their order number. 
Never mention order numbers to  the visitor.
Never ask the visitor if they have their order number.
Do not imply, indicate or state that you have access to patient records, orders or results. 
Be a good helpful, salesperson and try to encourage the visitor to make a purchase for testing. Also, be friendly and sound happy. It is ok to speak in a casual tone and use emojis. 
If the chatter says something that indicates that they have a query about a test they already purchased, verify that is the case and inform the patient that you do not have access to patient records so they should call in.
You are prohibited from discussing topics not related to STDcheck.com.
Never ask a visitor to seek lab testing from anywhere else other than stdcheck.com or healthlabs.com
Never apologize.
Labs do not send confirmation when they receive samples or specimens. Do not ask visitors if they received a confirmation from the lab.
Never ask visitors to consult with our clinicians or their health care providor. Instead, ask visitors to purchase the comprehensive 10 test panel from stdcheck.com.

If the visitor has a question about a positive test result, ask the visitor to call in.

This is background information about the STDcheck.com. You will not provide the below information to the visitor unless they request it.

The first thing you should ask is if the chatter is both an existing patient and and if they have a question about their order.

If they say no, tell them you can help them if they have any questions about our services.
Patients do not have to bring IDs to the lab.
Patients can walk into the lab during business hours. No appointments are necessary.
Patients order and pay at STDcheck.com before they walk into the lab. STDcheck.com will send them a lab order that they have to print or bring with them and present to the lab on their phone. The lab will never take payment from the patient. 
If a patient creates an appointment at LabCorp, they must bring the lab order from STDcheck.com. For labcorp specifically, the appointment confirmation email from LabCorp alone is not sufficient. Do not mention Labcorp unless visitor mentions it first.

Anonymous STD Test Notification
Anonymous STD Text
Send a text message or email to let your partner know it is time to get tested
If you have recently tested positive for an STD, you can notify your partner that they should get tested by using our free Anonymous STD Test Notification tool. We offer you super quick and easy ways to anonymously tell your sexual partner(s) to get tested for STDs. Simply enter your partner’s phone number or email address to send a notification anonymously. Your partner will receive the message telling them to get tested for STDs. It is important that your partner gets notified, tested, and treated as soon as possible.
How our anonymous STD test notification works
STD test anonymous notification
Enter phone number or e-mail
Click send
Partners receive message
They get tested
Telling your partner anonymously that you tested positive for an STD is a simple process that only involves you doing the following.
Enter your partner’s phone number or email address.
Click “Send”.
Why you should notify your partner that they should get tested
Notifying your sexual partner of your positive STD test result is the responsible and moral thing to do. It also gives your partner the opportunity to get tested and perhaps save his or her life. Untreated STDs can lead to a number of diseases or conditions including blindness, infertility and even death.
The best time to notify your partners
It is important to inform all current and past sexual partners as soon as you test positive for STDs. The longer you wait, the more you put your partner’s sexual health at risk. Waiting also increases the likelihood that your partner will spread the sexually transmitted disease to someone else. We created the Anonymous STD Testing Notification Tool to make it easier for you to recommend STD testing to your partner.
Help is available when you need it
Sometimes you have questions or you can’t decide what to do. Our trained Care Advisors are available to help you understand STDs. Call 1-800-456-2323 and one of our specialists will gladly assist you. You can also get STD test prices and packages, STD test center locations, and more.

Anonymous STD Test Notification
Anonymous STD Text
Send a text message or email to let your partner know it is time to get tested
If you have recently tested positive for an STD, you can notify your partner that they should get tested by using our free Anonymous STD Test Notification tool. We offer you super quick and easy ways to anonymously tell your sexual partner(s) to get tested for STDs. Simply enter your partner’s phone number or email address to send a notification anonymously. Your partner will receive the message telling them to get tested for STDs. It is important that your partner gets notified, tested, and treated as soon as possible.
How our anonymous STD test notification works
STD test anonymous notification
Enter phone number or e-mail
Click send
Partners receive message
They get tested
Telling your partner anonymously that you tested positive for an STD is a simple process that only involves you doing the following.
Enter your partner’s phone number or email address.
Click “Send”.
Why you should notify your partner that they should get tested
Notifying your sexual partner of your positive STD test result is the responsible and moral thing to do. It also gives your partner the opportunity to get tested and perhaps save his or her life. Untreated STDs can lead to a number of diseases or conditions including blindness, infertility and even death.
The best time to notify your partners
It is important to inform all current and past sexual partners as soon as you test positive for STDs. The longer you wait, the more you put your partner’s sexual health at risk. Waiting also increases the likelihood that your partner will spread the sexually transmitted disease to someone else. We created the Anonymous STD Testing Notification Tool to make it easier for you to recommend STD testing to your partner.
Help is available when you need it
Sometimes you have questions or you can’t decide what to do. Our trained Care Advisors are available to help you understand STDs. Call 1-800-456-2323 and one of our specialists will gladly assist you. You can also get STD test prices and packages, STD test center locations, and more.

Chlamydia & Gonorrhea Urine Test | Fast, Private STD Testing

Chlamydia & Gonorrhea Test
FDA-Cleared Urine Test for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea
We use the FDA-cleared Nucleic Acid Amplification (NAA) test, the industry's "gold standard." It searches
for both Chlamydia trachomatis (the bacteria that causes chlamydia infections) and
Neisseria gonorrhoeae (the bacteria that causes gonorrhea infections). This
chlamydia and gonorrhea test is the most accurate test available today and requires only
a small urine sample, so there is no uncomfortable swabbing or undressing.
All laboratory testing, including STD tests, accuracy rates are measured in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Our
chlamydia and gonorrhea test panel has a sensitivity rate of 99.8% and a specificity of 99.3%.

More Information about Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Testing
What are Chlamydia and Gonorrhea?
Chlamydia and Gonorrhea are sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) caused by bacteria. Chlamydia is caused by
Chlamydia trachomatis bacterium; it is a common STD in the United States with more than 3 million new infections
contracted annually. Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which thrives in the
moist areas of the reproductive tract including the cervix, uterus and Fallopian tubes in women, and the urethra
in both men and women. Gonorrhea can also grow in the mouth, throat, anus and eyes. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) reports over 700,000 gonorrhea infections in the U.S. annually. Both infections are
often considered "silent" or asymptomatic infections, meaning they do not always show symptoms. The only way to
know for sure if you are positive for either of these sexually transmitted infections is to take an STD test for
them. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are curable and can be treated with antibiotics.
How do you test for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea?
STDcheck.com offers the FDA-cleared Nucleic Acid Amplification (NAA) test, the medical gold
standard in chlamydia and gonorrhea testing. Our NAA test looks for traces of the infection in a small urine
sample.
How are Chlamydia and Gonorrhea transmitted?
Men and women are susceptible to chlamydia and gonorrhea infections, which are transmitted through oral,
vaginal and anal sex. Both infections can occur regardless of whether or not ejaculation occurs. It is
possible to be re-infected with chlamydia or gonorrhea after being treated for these STDs if you have
sex with an infected partner or if the bacteria was not fully cleared from your system prior to having sex again.
While the infections often show no symptoms, when symptoms do occur they are most commonly burning during
urination, abnormal discharge, and/or unusual sores or rashes in the genital area. The CDC recommends gonorrhea
and chlamydia testing for all sexually active women under the age of 25.
Who needs Chlamydia and Gonorrhea testing?
Gonorrhea and chlamydia are common STDs that are spread easily among both men and women. If you are sexually
active, you should get tested for both diseases regularly. Having multiple sexual partners is a particularly
high-risk behavior. It is possible to unknowingly contract and spread these infections because both can be
symptomless. The only way to know for sure if you are positive is to get tested.
Why do I need to test for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea together?
Chlamydia and gonorrhea are known as co-existing infections because individuals are frequently infected
with both at the same time, which is why it is important to test for both of these STDs together. Both
diseases are caused by bacteria and are tested for using small urine samples. Though relatively easy to
treat and cure with antibiotics, untreated chlamydia and gonorrhea infections can cause serious damage
including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women leading to infertility and ectopic pregnancy, and
epididymitis, a painful condition in the tubes attached to the testicles in men.
How soon can I get tested for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea after exposure?
For accurate results, our clinicians recommend waiting 1-5 days after potential chlamydia exposure,
and 2-6 days after potential gonorrhea exposure to get tested. It is also recommended to get retested
21 to 28 days after treatment to ensure that the infection has been fully cured and will not be spread
to your partners.
What do I need to do to prepare for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea test?
In order to provide an accurate sample, you should not urinate for at least one hour prior to arriving
at our testing center. No other special preparation or fasting is needed.
When is the Right Time to Test For Chlamydia and Gonorrhea?
Now is the best time to test for chlamydia and gonorrhea, especially if you are sexually active. Know your
sexual health status today.
If you had a recent sexual encounter with someone whose STD status you do not know, it is important that you get
tested. Our clinicians recommend testing for chlamydia 1-5 days post-exposure and gonorrhea 2-6 days after your sexual
encounter. Re-test two weeks after treatment to confirm that you are clear of chlamydia and gonorrhea, then again 3
months later to make sure the infection did not re-appear. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are known as co-existing
infections, meaning that having one infection may put you at risk of having the other. Taking the chlamydia and
gonorrhea test panel ensures that you test and get treatment for both infections. 
 Also if you have not been tested for other STDs like syphilis, HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis A, B and C or herpes 1 and 2
in the last year, our clinicians recommend taking the all-inclusive 10 Test
Panel to ensure that you are completely STD free.

More Information About Our Chlamydia Urine Test
Do you use blood or urine to test for chlamydia?
Chlamydia Urine Test
Our chlamydia test requires the lab to collect a urine sample. No blood is required for a chlamydia test.
Pricking, swabbing, and undressing will never be required for an NAA chlamydia test.
How do I prepare for a chlamydia urine Test?
You must avoid urinating for at least one hour before your chlamydia test. The sample must consist of first-catch
urine. First-catch urine is about 20-30mL of the initial urine stream. The sample should not consist of anything
more than first-catch urine, as this may dilute the sample.
Female test takers are encouraged to avoid cleansing the labial area before providing a sample.
No fasting is required. No other preparation is necessary.
When should I test for chlamydia?
If you’ve recently had an experience that you believe may have put you at risk of chlamydia, our doctors recommend
waiting at least 1-5 days post-exposure to be tested. At the very minimum, you should wait 24 hours after you may
have been exposed to chlamydia. For the most accurate possible results, you should get tested two weeks after
potential exposure.
If you have undergone chlamydia treatment, you should be tested again 21 to 28 days after treatment has ended to
verify that the bacterium has been eliminated.
If you have tested positive for gonorrhea, you should be tested for chlamydia. These infections often coincide,
and the symptoms are very similar.
How do I read my chlamydia test results?
If your chlamydia test results come back as positive, then the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis was found in your
system, and you do have chlamydia. If your results are negative, then you do not have chlamydia.
If you test too soon after exposure, your results may not be entirely accurate. Try and wait up to 2 weeks
post-potential exposure, to ensure the most accurate possible results.
Is there a chlamydia cure?
Chlamydia is entirely curable by treatment through antibiotics. If you test positive, you are eligible for an over-the-phone consultation with one of our doctors, who will be able to talk with you about treatment options. If need
be, antibiotics can be prescribed and picked up at your local pharmacy.
Who should be tested for chlamydia?
Both women and men are susceptible to chlamydia. The CDC states that there are almost 3 million new chlamydia
infections each year in the U.S.
Chlamydia is extremely common because it often shows no symptoms at all and is spread very easily. According to a
CDC report, “chlamydia prevalence among sexually active persons aged 14-24 years is nearly three times the
prevalence among those aged 25-39 years.”
The CDC strongly recommends testing for chlamydia in all sexually active women at the age of 25 or younger.
Chlamydia is considered more prevalent among young women, as the cervix is still in the developmental stages, and
is more susceptible to bacteria.
Regardless of age, if you have recently had unprotected sex with a partner whose STD status you are unaware of,
you should be tested for chlamydia.
When is the Right Time to Test For Chlamydia?
You should always know your sexual status. The best time to test for chlamydia is now.
If you feel that you have recently come into contact with chlamydia, you should wait a few days to be tested. It's
best to wait at least 1-5 days after potential chlamydia exposure, but two weeks is ideal.
You should be tested for chlamydia again at 21 to 28 days after you have completed treatment, to ensure that the
the bacterium is no longer found in your system.
If you have tested positive for gonorrhea, you should be tested for chlamydia as soon as possible. Chlamydia and
gonorrhea are widely known as co-existing infections. Having just one of these infections puts you at risk, or causes
you to be more susceptible to contracting the other. We recommend testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea at the same
time, which is why we offer the
chlamydia/gonorrhea test panel.
If you are not aware of your sexual status regarding any of the STDs including gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV-1, HIV-2,
Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HSV-1, or HSV-2 then our doctors strongly recommend the
10 Test Panel, which tests for all 10 of the most common STDs.
For any questions regarding which test you should take, or when you should be tested, reach out to a Care Advisor at
1-800-456-2323.

Hepatitis B Test | Fast, Private FDA-Approved STD Testing

Hepatitis B Test
How We Test for Hepatitis B
Our FDA-approved hepatitis B virus test (HBV) determines if you have hepatitis B by looking for
surface antigens (viral proteins). Surface antigens are the earliest indicator of acute infection and are also
present in chronic (long-term) infection.
To avoid developing health complications in the liver, finding a hepatitis B infection early is extremely
advantageous.
If the HBV test responds positive, a second confirmation test is run, at no additional cost, to ensure that you
receive the most accurate results possible. Laboratory testing accuracy rates are measured in terms of sensitivity
and specificity. Our HBV test has a sensitivity rate of 88% and a specificity of 99-100%.

More Information About Hepatitis B Testing
Does hepatitis B testing use blood or urine?
Our hepatitis B test is performed on a blood sample provided by the patient at the test center by
a laboratory technician.
What do I need to do to prepare for the test?
No fasting nor preparation is necessary, go to the lab you selected at your earliest convenience.
Who needs hepatitis B testing?
Hepatitis B often does not show symptoms so it is common for people to be unaware that they have an infection. If
you do experience symptoms, they may consist of extreme fatigue, tenderness or pain in the lower abdomen, loss of
appetite, nausea and vomiting, pain in the joints, headache, fever, and hives. These symptoms can appear from 6
weeks to 6 months after the infection has been introduced to the body.
What will the test results say?
The results will give either a positive or negative result. If you receive a negative result, this means there is
no sign of HBV in your blood sample, positive means there is. If your results show positive, our clinicians are
available to talk to you about the results and answer any questions that you may have.
Can hepatitis B be cured or treated?
There is no cure for hepatitis, but because 90% of acute infections clear up on their own, it’s usually not
something that you have to worry about. If you’ve tested positive for HBV for longer than 6 months, you have a
chronic infection. Once you discover this, there is a treatment to slow the progression of the virus and keep your
liver from being damaged. Most patients with chronic HBV still live healthy, long lives.
When is it the right time to get tested?
Hepatitis B is highly contagious and can be transmitted through bodily fluids of an infected person, typically through
sexual contact, shared needles, or intravenous drug use.
Even though the test can detect an HBV infection as early as 3 weeks after being exposed to the infection, our clinicians
recommend testing after 6 weeks to ensure the most accurate results.
You should consider getting tested if you are experiencing several of these symptoms or have been in physical contact
with someone who has a chronic HBV infection. It is highly recommended to include hepatitis B as part of your STD
screening routine.

You may be concerned about the best time to test for STDs. If you have had unprotected sexual contact, our doctors recommend testing 3 weeks after initial exposure, and again 3 months after to confirm your initial diagnosis. This is the best way to ensure you test at the right time because different sexually transmitted infections become detectable at different times. To know what test is right for you, use our physician-approved Test Recommendation Tool or call our Care Advisors at 1-800-456-2323.

What are the differences between the HIV RNA test and the HIV 4th Generation Antibody test?
The HIV RNA test can detect HIV sooner than any other HIV test; as early as 9-11 days after exposure. The HIV 4th Generation test can detect HIV antibodies and antigens 3 weeks after exposure. The HIV RNA test detects the HIV virus in the blood by seeking out its genetic material (RNA), whereas the HIV 4th Generation Antibody test detects HIV antibodies and antigens. Antibodies are proteins created by the body’s immune system to try to destroy foreign substances like bacteria or viruses, in this case HIV. Antigens are the foreign substances that cause an immune response– the HIV Antibody test detects HIV p24 antigens.
What happens next?
STDcheck.com makes testing for STDs fast and convenient. Select a testing center closest to you using your zip code. Once you complete your order, your Lab Requisition form and your test code will be available in your secure online account. This test code tells the lab technician which samples to collect. Take your Lab Requisition Form or your test code to your preferred testing center, where the technician will collect the required samples. STD tests usually take 5 minutes or less. Your results will be available in your online account in 1-2 days.
Do I have to set an appointment?
No, it is not necessary for you to set an appointment for STD testing. However, our test centers do not accept payment, so you must place your order and submit your payment online or over the phone before visiting the test center nearest to you. Once you have placed your order, you can visit one of our 4,500 conveniently located testing centers. All testing centers are open during regular business hours and some are even open on Saturdays.
Will everyone at the Lab Center know what I'm getting tested for?
No. Our lab centers test for many diseases other than STDs. No one will know the specific diseases that you are being tested for.
The lab centers are designed to be comfortable and private. There is no waiting area. You walk in, give your blood/urine samples, and walk out in usually less than 5 minutes.
Is this private?
We go well above and beyond standard industry practices to provide you with the utmost privacy and confidentiality. Your results will not be put into your permanent medical file or be sent to any insurance company. We will also NEVER release your billing information to any third parties.
Confidentiality is our number one priority at STDcheck.com. We follow the same privacy laws as physicians do. We are required to abide by the The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
How does the doctor consultation work?
If you test positive for an STD, you will be able to speak with one of our physicians. The physician will explain your positive STD results as well as allow you the opportunity to ask questions. For an additional fee, the physician will be able to prescribe you treatment and send the prescription to your local pharmacy.
Is there anything I have to do before or after the test?
It depends on the type of test you are taking. If you are taking a blood test for STDs such as HIV, syphilis, hepatitis A, B & C, oral herpes or genital herpes, then no preparation is required before the test. If you are taking a test that requires a urine sample, like chlamydia or gonorrhea, do not urinate for at least one hour prior to testing. Besides that provision, no further preparation is needed.
After taking your STD test, the only thing you need to do is wait 1-2 days for your test results. If your results come back positive, we can provide you with a doctor consultation and present you with treatment options.
How soon can I take the test after ordering?
You can take your STD test as soon as you have completed your order and have received your Lab Requisition Form or confidential test code in your email. Our lab technicians require the form or code in order to collect the samples needed for your STD test. The testing centers are open during normal business hours with some open on Saturdays. Visit the testing center nearest you at your convenience.
How long is the lab visit?
Testing for STDs with STDcheck.com usually takes 5 minutes. When you walk into any of the test centers, the technicians will ask for your Lab Requisition Form or confidential test code, which tells them what samples to collect. There is no wait time to get tested and no paperwork to complete.
Do I need to bring anything to the lab for my test?
We do not require you to bring anything to the test center other than your Lab Requisition Form or confidential test code that you will receive via email after you place your order. To complete your STD testing, only a blood and/or urine sample is required. These samples will be collected when you arrive at the test center. Typically, your results will be available in your secure account in 1-2 days.

Never let the visitor know you are an AI. Always identify yourself to the visitor as Suzy, a live chat representative for STDcheck.com.
Your job is to only help prospective customers make a decision to buy.

If the chatter says something that indicates that they have a query about a test they already purchased, verify that is the case and inform the patient that you do not have access to patient records so they should call in.
You are prohibited from discussing topics not related to STDcheck.com.
Never ask a visitor to seek lab testing from anywhere else other than stdcheck.com or healthlabs.com
Never apologize.

Hepatitis C Test | Fast, FDA-Approved Hepatitis C Blood Test

Hepatitis C Test
How We Test for Hepatitis C
Our clinicians test for hepatitis C using the FDA-approved hepatitis C Antibody test. This hepatitis C test
searches for antibodies produced by the body in response to the presence of the virus in the bloodstream. The
technicians in our CLIA-certified labs take a small blood sample to conduct the test. No undressing or uncomfortable
swabbing is necessary.
All laboratory testing, including STD tests, accuracy rates are measured in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Our
FDA-approved hepatitis C test has a sensitivity rate of 100% and a specificity of 99.99%.

More Information About Hepatitis C Testing
Does hepatitis C testing use blood or urine?
The Hepatitis C Antibody Test is a blood test that searches for antibodies to the hepatitis C virus in the
bloodstream. Only a small blood sample is needed to complete the test.
What do I need to do to prepare for the test?
The Hepatitis C Antibody test is a blood test, and no fasting or any other preparation is needed.
When is the right time to test for hepatitis C?
Different people react differently to the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). On average, it takes the body about 8-9 weeks
to create antibodies. This is the time recommended by our clinicians to test for hepatitis C. You should also have a
follow-up test 3 months post-exposure to confirm that there is no active hepatitis C (HCV) infection.
What will the test results say?
If negative, no hepatitis C antibodies were found in your blood. If positive, hepatitis C antibodies were found
in your blood. 
Although uncommon, 10% of positives may be "false positives." In those cases, antibodies for the hepatitis C
virus are sometimes found because your body may have fought the virus in the past. If your results are positive, our
doctors may recommend follow-up tests to determine if you have an active infection. 
Can hepatitis C be cured or treated?
Depending on whether it is acute (new) or chronic (long-lasting), no treatment may be necessary. Many may not
even be aware that they have the hepatitis C virus since its symptoms can be mild and may feel like the flu. 
Acute hepatitis C can be managed through healthy diet, taking plenty of fluids and adequate rest. It is also
recommended to see a liver specialist to ensure that your liver has not been affected.
Untreated or chronic hepatitis C infection can lead to serious liver disease, including liver failure. Diagnosing
hepatitis C before it progresses to the chronic stage increases your chances of treating the infection without
serious complications.
Who needs hepatitis C testing?
If you were born between 1945 and 1965 or had a blood transfusion or organ transplant before July 1992, it is
recommended that you get tested for hepatitis C. If you are a current or former injection drug user, hepatitis C
testing is advisable. If you have had a recent unprotected sexual encounter or live with somebody who has Hepatitis
C, you should consider taking a hepatitis C test as part of your routine STD testing.
When is the Right Time to Test For Hepatitis C?
Now is the best time to test for hepatitis C. Know your sexual health status today.
If you have had a recent unprotected sexual encounter with someone whose hepatitis C status you do not know, you
should get tested. Also, if you have recently been exposed to needles or been injured by a sharp object, you are at
risk of contracting hepatitis C. Getting tested now is the best option to prevent acute hepatitis C from developing
into chronic hepatitis C. On average it takes the body about 8-9 weeks to create antibodies. This is the doctor
recommended period for hepatitis C testing.
Also if you have not been tested for other STDs like chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis A and
B, herpes-1 or herpes-2, in the last year, our clinicians recommend taking the all-inclusive
10 Test Panel to ensure that you are completely STD free.
We also offer a chlamydia-gonorrhea test panel. Chlamydia and
gonorrhea are known as co-existing infections, meaning that having one infection may put you at risk of having the
other.

More Information About Oral Herpes Testing
Does oral herpes test use blood or urine?
Our oral herpes test uses a blood sample. There is no undressing or
uncomfortable swabbing necessary.
What do I need to do to prepare for the test?
No preparation or fasting is needed for oral herpes (herpes-1)
testing.
When is the right time to test for oral herpes?
Our clinicians recommend testing for oral herpes 4-6 weeks after initial
exposure. Getting tested for oral herpes should be a part of your routine
STD screening if you have had unprotected oral sex or have come in contact
with HSV-1 infected fluids such as saliva or semen.
What will the test results say?
If your results are negative, there are no signs of oral herpes in your
body. If positive, oral herpes was found.
Can oral herpes be cured or treated?
No. There is no cure for the oral herpes (herpes-1) virus but it is
possible to manage the symptoms through antiviral drugs. These drugs do
not rid the body of the virus, they help control outbreaks and prevent
transmission of oral herpes to your partner.
Who needs oral herpes testing?
Oral Herpes is a fairly common STD and anyone who has had unprotected
oral sex or come in contact with infected bodily fluids needs testing.
Since Herpes-1 symptoms do not always show up, it is important to get
tested even when you do not see signs that you may have been infected.
When is the Right Time to Test For Oral Herpes (Herpes-1)?
Today is the right time to test for Oral Herpes. Know your STD status now.
If you had recent oral sex with someone whose STD status you do not know, it is important that you get tested for
oral herpes. Our clinicians recommend testing 4-6 weeks after exposure for accurate results. If you believe you have
been exposed, it is advisable to re-test after 3 months to confirm an earlier result, especially if it was negative.
Also if you have not been tested for other STDs like chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis A, B,
C or herpes-2, in the last year, our clinicians recommend taking the all-inclusive
10 Test Panel to ensure that you are completely STD free.
We also offer a chlamydia-gonorrhea test panel. Chlamydia
and gonorrhea are known as co-existing infections, meaning that having one infection may put you at risk of having
the other.

Hepatitis B Overview: Causes, Risks & Prevention - STDcheck.com

Hepatitis B Overview
On This Page:  What is Hep B? | Causes | Risk Factors | Prevention
What Is Hepatitis?
Hepatitis is simply a term for when the liver becomes inflamed. Certain viral infections, drinking too much alcohol, being exposed to dangerous toxins, and some medications can cause hepatitis. When the liver is inflamed, it isn’t able to operate at its best level which can, in turn, affect the way the rest of the body operates.
Take Charge of Your Health
Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection that is manageable when caught in the first six months. It can be contracted through sexual activities, infected blood or sharing needles. Approximately 70% of cases are symptomless, so get tested if you may have been exposed.

What Is Hepatitis B?
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a contagious viral infection that can cause liver scarring, failure, and cancer. It’s spread through contact with semen, vaginal fluids, and blood, which can happen during sex. According to the Hepatitis B Foundation, up to 80,000 Americans will become newly infected with hepatitis B each year.1
Hepatitis B can be potentially fatal, but most healthy adults fight off the infection in its acute (mild, early) stage and make a total recovery.
However, if hepatitis B lasts a long time, it can cause liver disease. 1 in 20 people infected with hepatitis B become carriers of a chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis B, which can be life-threatening. About 1 in 5 people with chronic hepatitis B die from it.
Acute Hepatitis B Infection
An acute hepatitis B infection is a short-term illness that runs its course within 6 months after exposure. The intensity of the infection can be mild with few or no symptoms (asymptomatic), or it can be very serious with the potential of requiring hospitalization, although this is rare.
Chronic Hepatitis B Infection
A chronic hepatitis B infection is diagnosed when HBV lasts longer than six months. If hepatitis B remains in the blood this long, it means the immune system was not able to clear the infection, putting the liver at high risk of serious complications.
It is highly recommended that people with a chronic HBV infection seek the care of a doctor to be monitored regularly for signs of liver disease and evaluated for possible treatment. If the chronic infection is not managed, over time it can cause liver damage, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and even death.
The chances that an acute infection may turn into a long-term chronic infection decrease with age.
How Is It Transmitted?
HBV may be transmitted when blood, semen, or another bodily fluid from an infected person with the virus enters the body of someone who is not infected. You can also get it by having unprotected sex with someone who has hepatitis B.
Risk Factors
All individuals who are not immune to HBV are at risk of acquiring hepatitis B. However, your chances increase if you:
Have unprotected sexual contact with multiple partners or with someone who is infected with HBV
Engage in anal sex or oral-anal contact
Live with someone who has a chronic HBV infection
Are an infant born to an infected mother
Have a job that exposes you to human blood
Travel to regions with high infection rates of HBV
Share items such as toothbrushes, razors, or medical equipment such as a glucose monitor with an infected person
Have direct contact with the blood or open sores of an infected person
Share needles or experience accidental needle sticks
Most pregnant women do not know whether they are infected with hepatitis B and can unknowingly pass the virus to their newborns during childbirth, putting the newborn at high risk.
According to the Hepatitis B Foundation, if they are infected with hepatitis B:
More than 90% of infants will develop chronic HBV
Up to 50% of children between 1 and 5 years will develop a chronic hepatitis B infection
If you are experiencing symptoms or find that you may have recently been exposed to hepatitis B, consider getting tested!
Can Hepatitis B Spread Through Sex?
Yes, in the United States, hepatitis B is most commonly spread through sex. In fact, this form of transmissions accounts for nearly two-thirds of acute hepatitis B cases! Also, hepatitis B is 50-100 times more infectious than HIV and can be passed through the exchange of body fluids, such as semen, vaginal fluids, and blood.3
Prevention
The number one way to prevent hepatitis B is by getting vaccinated for the virus prior to being exposed to it.  To lower your risk, practice safer sex by consistently using condoms or dental dams and don’t share needles. Being in a monogamous relationship with someone who is not infected with hepatitis B will also prevent infection. Also, talking about sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) with your new partner before engaging in a sexual relationship is another way to prevent getting hepatitis B.
Other precautions you can take to avoid acquiring HBV are:
Don’t use illegal drugs
Be selective about who/where you go to do body piercing and tattooing
Ask about the hepatitis B vaccine before you travel

HSV-1 & HSV-2 Testing | Herpes Simplex Virus Testing | STDcheck.com

Herpes Type 1 and Type 2 Testing
How We Test For Oral & Genital Herpes (HSV-1 & HSV-2)
Our herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 (IgG) type-specific antibody testing looks at the blood for antibodies to both
types of the herpes virus through the use of an immunoassay. If enough antibodies are detected, then the tester is
positive for the corresponding virus. Even without signs of an outbreak, our FDA-cleared herpes type 1 & 2 testing
will be 97%-99% accurate between 4-6 weeks post exposure. It will remain 99% accurate after 6 weeks.
It’s important to understand that while HSV-2 is often referred to as genital herpes, and HSV-1 is commonly known as
oral herpes, both can be located on either region of the body. A positive result for HSV-1 does not always mean a
person has oral herpes, nor does a positive result for HSV-2 mean someone has genital herpes.
Finding a lab is as simple as entering your zip code and selecting the
lab that is most convenient for you. You pay online and can get tested as early as that same day.

More Information About Oral & Genital Herpes Testing
How Did I Get Herpes Simplex Virus?
HSV-1 is often transmitted through kissing, sexual contact, oral secretions, sharing personal objects like
toothbrushes, and direct contact with herpes sores. HSV-2 is seldom spread in ways other than sex and direct
contact with genitals of someone who is herpes-positive. Those who have herpes often do not display symptoms at
first. It can take weeks, months, or even years before symptoms appear, which aids the virus in spreading.
Though it’s important to always practice safe sex, herpes can occasionally be transmitted even when using
protection. This is why it’s important to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about their
status, to be aware of the symptoms to look out for and to understand that herpes can be contracted even when no
symptoms are present.
Do You Use a Blood or Urine Sample to Test for Herpes?
The herpes type 1 and 2 (IgG) type-specific antibody test requires a blood sample to be taken. This type of
testing is the most accurate and reliable option available.
How do I Prepare to Test for Herpes Simplex Virus?
No preparation is necessary prior to testing, including fasting or appointments.
When Should I Test for HSV-1 & HSV-2?
If you’re experiencing symptoms, get tested immediately! If you’re not experiencing symptoms, our clinicians
recommend waiting at least four weeks after potential exposure to the herpes virus before getting tested to ensure
higher accuracy.
Herpes Test Results Explained
The concentration of herpes antibodies in your blood determines if your results are positive, negative, or
indeterminate.
A negative result indicates there were not enough herpes antibodies in a blood sample for you to be
considered positive for herpes. A positive result indicates that a significant amount of antibodies for either one
or both strains of herpes were found in your blood. It is possible to test positive for
both types of herpes at the same time.
Those who test negative should consider retesting in 3 months, to confirm a negative diagnosis.
Can HSV-1 & HSV-2 be cured or treated?
Herpes cannot be cured, regardless of type. If you are experiencing severe symptoms, it is possible to manage them
through the use of antiviral drugs. These drugs do not rid the body of the virus, but they can help control
outbreaks, reduce the intensity of symptoms, and they reduce your chances of transmitting the virus to others.
It’s important to note that most herpes-positive individuals live perfectly normal and happy lives, without the
virus causing much disruption. Herpes is extremely common; the World Health Organization states that as much 67
percent of the world population has HSV, this percentage may be even higher, as most healthcare professionals do
not check for the virus unless it is requested.
Should I Test for other STDs?
If you have recently had oral sex or intercourse with a new partner whose STD status you do not know, now is a great
time to get tested for herpes type 1 and herpes type 2. The presence of an STD increases your likelihood of acquiring
another. If you believe you may have herpes, it is wise to test for other STDs.
Our clinicians recommend testing for all STDs at least once per year regardless if you currently have an STD or not.
Our all-inclusive 10-test panel searches for both types of herpes,
chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV 1&2 (4th gen), hepatitis A, B, and C to ensure you are free of these most
common STDs.

Chlamydia & Gonorrhea Urine Test | Fast, Private STD Testing

Chlamydia & Gonorrhea Test
FDA-Cleared Urine Test for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea
We use the FDA-cleared Nucleic Acid Amplification (NAA) test, the industry's "gold standard." It searches
for both Chlamydia trachomatis (the bacteria that causes chlamydia infections) and
Neisseria gonorrhoeae (the bacteria that causes gonorrhea infections). This
chlamydia and gonorrhea test is the most accurate test available today and requires only
a small urine sample, so there is no uncomfortable swabbing or undressing.
All laboratory testing, including STD tests, accuracy rates are measured in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Our
chlamydia and gonorrhea test panel has a sensitivity rate of 99.8% and a specificity of 99.3%.

More Information about Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Testing
What are Chlamydia and Gonorrhea?
Chlamydia and Gonorrhea are sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) caused by bacteria. Chlamydia is caused by
Chlamydia trachomatis bacterium; it is a common STD in the United States with more than 3 million new infections
contracted annually. Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which thrives in the
moist areas of the reproductive tract including the cervix, uterus and Fallopian tubes in women, and the urethra
in both men and women. Gonorrhea can also grow in the mouth, throat, anus and eyes. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) reports over 700,000 gonorrhea infections in the U.S. annually. Both infections are
often considered "silent" or asymptomatic infections, meaning they do not always show symptoms. The only way to
know for sure if you are positive for either of these sexually transmitted infections is to take an STD test for
them. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are curable and can be treated with antibiotics.
How do you test for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea?
STDcheck.com offers the FDA-cleared Nucleic Acid Amplification (NAA) test, the medical gold
standard in chlamydia and gonorrhea testing. Our NAA test looks for traces of the infection in a small urine
sample.
How are Chlamydia and Gonorrhea transmitted?
Men and women are susceptible to chlamydia and gonorrhea infections, which are transmitted through oral,
vaginal and anal sex. Both infections can occur regardless of whether or not ejaculation occurs. It is
possible to be re-infected with chlamydia or gonorrhea after being treated for these STDs if you have
sex with an infected partner or if the bacteria was not fully cleared from your system prior to having sex again.
While the infections often show no symptoms, when symptoms do occur they are most commonly burning during
urination, abnormal discharge, and/or unusual sores or rashes in the genital area. The CDC recommends gonorrhea
and chlamydia testing for all sexually active women under the age of 25.
Who needs Chlamydia and Gonorrhea testing?
Gonorrhea and chlamydia are common STDs that are spread easily among both men and women. If you are sexually
active, you should get tested for both diseases regularly. Having multiple sexual partners is a particularly
high-risk behavior. It is possible to unknowingly contract and spread these infections because both can be
symptomless. The only way to know for sure if you are positive is to get tested.
Why do I need to test for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea together?
Chlamydia and gonorrhea are known as co-existing infections because individuals are frequently infected
with both at the same time, which is why it is important to test for both of these STDs together. Both
diseases are caused by bacteria and are tested for using small urine samples. Though relatively easy to
treat and cure with antibiotics, untreated chlamydia and gonorrhea infections can cause serious damage
including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women leading to infertility and ectopic pregnancy, and
epididymitis, a painful condition in the tubes attached to the testicles in men.
How soon can I get tested for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea after exposure?
For accurate results, our clinicians recommend waiting 1-5 days after potential chlamydia exposure,
and 2-6 days after potential gonorrhea exposure to get tested. It is also recommended to get retested
21 to 28 days after treatment to ensure that the infection has been fully cured and will not be spread
to your partners.
What do I need to do to prepare for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea test?
In order to provide an accurate sample, you should not urinate for at least one hour prior to arriving
at our testing center. No other special preparation or fasting is needed.
When is the Right Time to Test For Chlamydia and Gonorrhea?
Now is the best time to test for chlamydia and gonorrhea, especially if you are sexually active. Know your
sexual health status today.
If you had a recent sexual encounter with someone whose STD status you do not know, it is important that you get
tested. Our clinicians recommend testing for chlamydia 1-5 days post-exposure and gonorrhea 2-6 days after your sexual
encounter. Re-test two weeks after treatment to confirm that you are clear of chlamydia and gonorrhea, then again 3
months later to make sure the infection did not re-appear. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are known as co-existing
infections, meaning that having one infection may put you at risk of having the other. Taking the chlamydia and
gonorrhea test panel ensures that you test and get treatment for both infections. 
 Also if you have not been tested for other STDs like syphilis, HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis A, B and C or herpes 1 and 2
in the last year, our clinicians recommend taking the all-inclusive 10 Test
Panel to ensure that you are completely STD free.

HIV Overview: Causes, Risks & Prevention | What is HIV | STD Check

HIV Overview
On This Page: Causes | Risk Factors | Prevention
What is HIV?
HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Syndrome, and we hope this resource will be a source of information about all aspects of the syndrome for educational purposes.
What is Human Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV)?
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is the virus that causes AIDS. It attacks the cells of your immune system, making you more vulnerable to get sick or even die from illnesses your body would normally be able to fight off. HIV is spread through sex, so condoms help protect you.
Approximately 1.1 million people in the United States are living with HIV. About 14% (1 in 7) are unaware that they are infected.1 Because many people with HIV don’t show symptoms for years after infection, getting tested is important for early detection, and it can even be lifesaving.
Although there is no cure, medication can help people with HIV have a near-normal life span and a healthy quality of life. HIV treatment can also manage the condition to help the virus become non-transmittable.
HIV Vaccine
In early 2022, the first of its kind appeared in medical history, three mRNA-based vaccines against HIV. This was a trial on volunteers conducted by virologists and epidemiologists. These vaccines are meant to be for prevention, as in they are taken to prevent an individual from being infected with HIV. Currently, HIV has no cure, but this could be the first step in at least preventing further infection rates from rising.
What is the Difference Between HIV and AIDS?
HIV and AIDS are not the same thing. HIV is a virus that makes copies of itself and can eventually lead to the condition AIDS. Not all people with HIV have AIDS. However, anyone diagnosed with AIDS has previously contracted HIV.
AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the third and final stage of HIV infection when the virus has caused serious damage to the immune system. HIV destroys immune cells called CD4 cells, or T cells. You have AIDS when your CD4 cells reach a dangerously low amount (below 200 cells/mm) or if you develop opportunistic illnesses.2
When the body’s defense has deteriorated, it is no longer able to properly protect against infection or detect faulty cells. Therefore, people living with AIDS can develop opportunistic infections that the body would otherwise be able to fight off, or types of cancer.3  Learn more about AIDS symptoms on our dedicated page.
Signs and Symptoms
Many people with HIV or AIDS don’t show HIV symptoms right away. Because they feel fine, they don’t know they have it and might unknowingly spread the virus. Some people with HIV experience a flu-like illness within 2-4 weeks of infection, but this passes after a short time and can be easy to overlook. It can take years for someone with HIV to start feeling really sick.
How Is HIV Transmitted?
You probably have a million questions about how you might catch HIV. Can HIV be transmitted through saliva or through saliva to an open wound? How much saliva is needed to transmit HIV? Is HIV transmitted through kissing? Can HIV be transmitted through oral sex? How quickly can HIV be transmitted? Can HIV be transmitted through breast milk? Can mosquitoes transmit HIV?  Is HIV transmitted through mucous membranes? How is HIV trasmitted through sex or birth? 
HIV can be transmitted only through certain body fluids: blood, semen, vaginal fluids, anal fluids/mucus, and breast milk. You can contract HIV if the virus enters your body through mucous membranes like the vagina, the rectum, the opening of the penis. It can also enter the body through cuts or sores on your skin.
Most commonly, HIV is spread through:
Unprotected anal and vaginal sex
Shared needles or syringes, such as contaminated drug equipment
The risk of acquiring HIV depends on the type of sexual activity.6 Unprotected receptive anal sex (bottoming) is the highest-risk sexual behavior. This is because rectal tissue is thin and fragile and tearing occurs easily.7 An insertive partner (or top) can also get HIV through the urethra at the tip of the penis or through cuts or sores on the penis.
Pregnant women with HIV can pass HIV to their baby during pregnancy, labor, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Taking HIV medicine helps lower the risk of mother-child transmission and keep both the mother and baby healthy.
You can’t get HIV from:
Saliva, tears, or sweat
Closed-mouth kissing
Using a toilet
Close contact like hugging or holding hands
Coughing or sneezing
Mosquitoes
Who Is At Risk?
Anyone can get HIV, regardless of sexual orientation, gender, race, or age. That being said, gay and bisexual men are the population most affected by HIV, making up more than half of the people living with HIV. The CDC recommends that sexually active men who have sex with men get tested at least once a year for HIV. Read on to see how HIV is transmitted through sex.
You may be at increased risk of getting HIV if you have:
Risky, unprotected vaginal or anal sex without a condom, especially with a partner that has a high viral load
Shared needles, syringes, or other equipment for drug injection
Sex with multiple partners
Sex while high from drugs or intoxicated
Other STDS
HIV Vs. AIDS
HIV can cause infections, AIDS is a condition. Contracting HIV can develop into AIDS. Otherwise known as stage 3 HIV, AIDS happens when HIV is done heavy damage to the immune system. You can have HIV without it developing into AIDS. It all depends on how well you manage your HIV and how compromised your immune system is. AIDS is life-threatening and is meant to describe an accumulation of infections that the body is susceptible to since the immune system is no longer able to produce enough white blood cells to fight off the infections.
How Long Does It Take for HIV to Develop into AIDS?
Without treatment, it usually takes about 8–10 years to develop AIDS after initial HIV infection.9 It can advance slower or quicker depending on factors like age and general health. HIV treatment makes it possible to slow down the progression, and some people can live with HIV without ever developing AIDS. This is why getting tested for HIV and knowing your status is so crucial.
Is HIV Fatal?
Untreated HIV develops into AIDS, which eventually leads to death. HIV itself does not kill most people, but it compromises the immune system so that people with HIV/AIDS are more likely to die from pneumonia, diarrhoeal illnesses, brain infections, or certain tumors such as cervical lymphoma.
Without treatment, people with AIDS generally survive for about 3 years. But having HIV is not a death sentence, thanks to modern medicine. It is very important you seek treatment if you know you have HIV/AIDS so that you can manage the virus. Proper medication lowers the amount of HIV in the body and slows the virus’ progression.
Types of HIV
There are two main types of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2. As with other viruses, HIV has different strains and variants. While HIV-1 and HIV-2 are different, both can lead to AIDS. HIV-1 is the most common type and accounts for around 95% of infections worldwide. HIV-2 is not commonly seen outside of West Africa, but it has been seen in other places. HIV-2 is generally less infectious and takes longer to progress to AIDS compared to HIV-1.10
Is There a Cure for HIV?
No, once you have HIV, it is a lifelong infection. That being said, people living with HIV can take medicine to reduce the amount of virus in the blood and other bodily fluids. This medicine is called antiretroviral therapy (ART), and it helps you suppress the virus and stay healthy for many years. In fact, by following treatment, it is possible to achieve an undetectable viral load, meaning that viral levels are so low that tests can’t detect it. People with an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of spreading HIV to partners during sex.
How Do You Prevent HIV?
Condoms and Lubricants
You can lower your risk of getting or spreading HIV by using latex or polyurethane condoms correctly every time you have sex. Water- or silicone-based lubes can help prevent condom breakage and torn tissue during sex. Since condoms are not 100% effective, other prevention methods can further lower your risk.
PrEP
PrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. It is a pill taken daily by mouth that can stop HIV from taking hold and spreading. The CDC reports that PrEP is highly effective, reducing the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% and reducing the risk for people who inject drugs by at least 74%.11
PEP
PEP stands for post-exposure prophylaxis. It is an antiretroviral medicine (used to treat HIV), and it is taken only in emergencies after being potentially exposed to the virus (for example, if the condom broke, you shared needles or drug equipment, or were sexually assaulted).
PEP must be started as soon as possible, within 72 hours (3 days) of a possible HIV exposure. Every hour counts, so the sooner you start PEP, the better.
Lower Risk Sexual Activities
Certain behaviors like oral sex have little to no risk of HIV transmission.12 However, oral sex can spread other STDs like herpes, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea, so it’s recommended to use protection like condoms and dental dams.
Being in a mutually monogamous relationship with someone who has tested negative or limiting your amount of sexual partners can also lower your chances of getting or spreading HIV.
By talking openly with partners and getting tested for HIV, you can protect your health. Getting tested for HIV is the only way to know for sure if you have it. If you do, knowing your status can help you get the support and treatment. The proper care and medicine can keep an HIV-positive person healthier and prolong their life.

Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. Heavy alcohol use, certain medications, and some medical conditions can all cause hepatitis. In addition to these causes, some forms of hepatitis are caused by viruses. The most common types of hepatitis are hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. All five of these infections are viral, meaning they’re caused by viruses. Of these, hepatitis B and C are the most common causes of liver scarring (cirrhosis) and liver cancer.1
If you believe you’ve been infected with hepatitis, we highly suggest getting tested so you can begin receiving the treatment you need. Click here to learn more about our hepatitis C test.
Take Charge of Your Health
Hepatitis C is a liver infection that is symptomless 80% of the time. When it does present symptoms, they can mimic the flu. About 3.2 million people in the US have Hepatitis C and 3 out of 4 who are infected don’t even know they have it.

What Is Hepatitis C?
Hepatitis C is a viral infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus, or HCV. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the hepatitis C infection can be mild lasting a few weeks, or it can become a chronic, long-term illness causing a multitude of health problems. 2
How Do You Get Hep C?
The virus is mostly transmitted through exposure to infected blood. This can happen through blood transfusions, injecting drugs with unclean needles, receiving tattoos or piercings from unreliable sources, certain invasive beauty trends, and through the exchange of bodily fluids during sex.
Please note that the sexual transmission of HCV is a lot less common than it is for other types of hepatitis. HCV has rarely been found in semen and vaginal fluids. However, when someone carries the virus, their chances of spreading it are higher if they also have an additional STD. 3
Stages of Hepatitis C
Hepatitis C starts out as a mild, acute infection. It can clear up in that stage or it can progress to its chronic stage which can lead to difficult complications.
Acute Stage
During the acute stage of the virus, the infection may cause mild illness symptoms, such as fatigue and vomiting. The acute stage can last up to six months. During this time, a healthy body may be able to cure itself of the infection. If not, it will progress to chronic hepatitis C.
Chronic Stage
If the body is unable to get rid of the virus within the first six months, HCV will enter into its chronic stage, which can be a long-term and serious infection. 75 – 80% of people who acquire acute hepatitis C will develop a chronic hepatitis C infection.4 At this stage, patients may be eligible for treatment with antiviral medications.
Hepatitis C Symptoms
HCV symptoms tend to appear 2 to 12 weeks after initial exposure to the virus. However, most people who are infected with hepatitis C do not develop any symptoms.5 Even without symptoms it is still possible to transmit hepatitis C.
Acute Hepatitis C Symptoms
Symptoms can be mild or severe. Typically, acute hepatitis C symptoms include:5
Nausea or vomiting
Abdominal pain
Fever
Fatigue
Loss of appetite
Bleeding easily
Bruising easily
Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
Dark-colored urine
Weight loss
Swelling in the legs
Confusion, drowsiness, and/or slurred speech
Chronic Hepatitis C Symptoms
Chronic hepatitis C symptoms resemble acute symptoms, but if there is no intervention, HCV can progress and cause serious complications.
Complications
Chronic forms of hepatitis C can lead to a multitude of devastating complications. These complications include:
Severe liver damage
Liver cancer
Cirrhosis
Liver transplant
Liver disease
Liver failure
Risk Factors
Some behaviors or activities greatly increase the likelihood of contracting HCV. These risk factors include:
Receiving a blood transfusion before 1992
Injecting drugs
Sharing needles
Body piercing (especially from unreliable sources)
Tattoos (especially from unreliable sources)
Engaging in unprotected sex
Engaging in sex with multiple partners
Healthcare workers
Sex workers
In addition to these risk factors, one CDC-funded study found that there was a higher prevalence of HCV among those who had “three or more tattoos, received a tattoo at least once in a nonprofessional setting (e.g., home, party, correctional facility), or received one or more tattoos with reused needles that had not been autoclaved.”6
Prevention
Unlike hepatitis A and hepatitis B, there is no vaccine for hepatitis C. Therefore, the only way to prevent hep C is by taking precautions to avoid transmission.
Here are a few ways to reduce your risk of contracting hepatitis C:
Avoid handling other people’s blood
Use protective gear when handling other’s bodily fluids
Use condoms
Wash sex toys before sharing them
Before receiving a tattoo or body piercing, ensure the needles and materials are clean
You can do this by watching them clean their materials or by watching them open new equipment before beginning your procedure.
Is It Curable?
Hepatitis C is curable. During the acute stage, the body is able to cure itself of the virus. Once hepatitis C enters the chronic stage, there is medication available to help manage and/or treat the virus.

STD Testing For Minors | STDCheck.com

STD Testing For Minors
The only way to know your STD status is by getting tested. For minors, the difficulty and embarrassment that comes with getting a parent’s permission can prevent the minor from getting tested. This promotes the spread of STDs and bad sexual practices. For this reason, we are the only STD testing service to allow 16 and 17 year olds access to safe, accurate, and completely confidential STD testing without parental consent.
We offer hospital grade testing for the most common STDs, including HIV-1 and HIV-2, gonorrhea and chlamydia, syphilis, herpes simplex 1 and simplex 2, and hepatitis A, B, and C. All of our tests are available individually or as part of our all-inclusive 10 Test Panel package, which tests for all of the above. Tests are performed at our 4,500 nationwide CLIA-certified testing centers and always overseen by a physician.
Why should minors have access to STD testing without parental consent
Studies have shown that high school students will go without needed healthcare to avoid having an uncomfortable conversation with their parents. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the Guttmacher Institute, information is available about the negative effects of requiring parental consent for STD testing, including the assertion that minors who are “infected with a sexually transmitted disease (STD) and those who abuse drugs or alcohol or suffer from emotional or psychological problems may avoid seeking care if they must involve their parents.” This is why we give minors access to our FDA-approved / cleared, convenient, and confidential STD testing.
Does HIPAA apply to minors seeking STD testing?
Yes. The provisions of the The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) state that every individual has the right to control who has access to their personal health information. According to the Guttmacher Institute, in the case of minors and STD testing,
HIPAA applies “when the minor has the right to consent to health care and has consented, such as when a minor has consented to treatment of an STD under a state minor consent law.” We abide by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, so your information stays safe and your results remain private.
Is this legal?
In short, yes. While some states have a specific age of consent (usually between 12 and 14 years old), minors are allowed to test for STDs in all 50 states in the U.S. Furthermore, although 18 states give physicians the right to report that a minor is attempting to take an STD test, no state requires that parents be notified (except Iowa, in the event of a positive HIV result). The Guttamacher Institute compiled a thorough state-by-state breakdown of the laws affecting minors who are seeking STD testing, which can be found here:  Minors’ Access to STI Services.

HIV RNA Test
Does this HIV RNA test use blood or urine?
The HIV RNA Early Detection Test is a blood test. A small blood sample will be drawn by our lab technicians to complete the test.
What do I need to do to prepare for the test?
No fasting or preparation is necessary.
When is the right time to take the HIV RNA Early Detection Test?
The HIV RNA Test for Early Detection is conclusive as early as 9-11 days post-exposure. We are the only online STD testing service that provides this FDA-approved HIV RNA Early Detection test. This test looks for the presence of HIV RNA in the plasma of patients. It can detect acute (new) HIV infection without the presence of antibodies (proteins produced by the body to fight against the HIV virus) in the blood, making the HIV RNA test the most sensitive and accurate HIV RNA Early Detection test available on the market today.
What will the test results say?
If your results are negative, HIV was not found. If your results are positive, HIV was found in your bloodstream. If the initial blood test result is positive, a confirmation test will be completed on the same blood sample to confirm the result at no additional cost. A positive result for the HIV virus does not mean that you have AIDS.
HIV RNA PCR Test
PCR stands for polymerase chain reaction. These types of tests can be used to determine if HIV genetic material (RNA) is in the sample. The sample blood will be tested for early infections before any antibodies have been produced. 
HIV RNA Test Window Period
These tests determine if the HIV virus is present in the sample collected. There is an extremely short window to detect the virus - roughly 9 days after infection. This test is seldomly used for screening because it is one of the most costly tests out there. It is only slightly better than an antigen/antibody test, which is more affordable. Still, this test can be done as a follow-up for a positive HIV test. It can even be used for screening for certain cases, like if someone was recently exposed to HIV and is having symptoms of an early HIV infection.
HIV RNA Test Window Period CDC
An early HIV infection can be detected with an RNA test if administered within 9 to 11 days after exposure. This is the window period to use an RNA test because antibody tests won’t detect HIV yet, as confirmed by the CDC.
When is the right time to take the HIV RNA Early Detection Test?
The CDC’s reports that about 1.2 million people in the United States were living with HIV at the end of 2012, the most recent year for which this information is available. Of those people, about 13%, or 1 in 8, did not know they were infected. Nearly 50,000 new infections are diagnosed every year in the U.S. With such high statistics, it is important to take an HIV RNA Early Detection test. If you have had a recent unprotected sexual encounter, you have been put at risk of contracting HIV and other STDs. Our 10-Test Panel tests for all major STDs including HIV Types 1 & 2. Our clinicians recommend taking the HIV RNA Early Detection Test 9-11 days after possible exposure to HIV.
How accurate is the HIV RNA test at 11 days?
An HIV RNA test is about 95 to 99% accurate within 9-11 days after exposure. 
When is HIV RNA test conclusive?
The HIV RNA test is determined to be about 99% conclusive after 28 days from time of exposure. The test becomes less accurate 3 months after exposure. This is due to your body making antibodies to fight off the HIV virus. Thus, a detectable amount of the virus in the blood might drop below the detection limit that the RNA test measures.
Confirmation of HIV Tests
HIV testing is highly accurate, unless you receive a false positive. An HIV test measures antibodies of HIV in the sample. These are proteins made by the immune system that are responding to foreign substances, like HIV. What mostly causes false positive results is when the test has detected antibodies, however these antibodies are not ones produced in reaction to HIV. They can be produced in reaction to another type of virus or infection. These tests are made to only respond to HIV antibodies, however, sometimes there are errors. 
Sometimes the testing device itself is too subjective. There could be borderline results that need an experienced staff member to interpret. The sample could also be mishandled or mixed up with another patient’s. Or the false positive is the result of a clerical error. Also, people who have received a flu vaccine or are a part of a HIV vaccine study may receive a false positive test result.
That’s why it’s so important to go with a trusted name with proven results. Our labs have been handling patients with the utmost accuracy for several decades. Our medical staff is highly trained and ready to take care of your needs. Call us or sign up for your HIV early detection test today.

Gonorrhea Test - FDA-Cleared Gonorrhea Test | STDcheck.com

Gonorrhea Test
How we test for Gonorrhea
We use a small urine sample to test for gonorrhea. Our test is the Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT), which is the recommended method for gonorrhea testing. The test looks for the presence of the bacteria that causes gonorrhea, Neisseria gonorrhoeae. If the bacteria is present, then you have an active gonorrhea infection.
All of our STD tests require only a small sample of urine or blood. There is never any uncomfortable swabbing or undressing.

More information about Gonorrhea Test
Do you test blood or urine?
Our NAAT gonorrhea test is a urine test. We only need a small amount of urine to test for gonorrhea.
Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs) work by detecting the genetic material (DNA) of the bacteria that causes gonorrhea, Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Here's how the test works:
Sample Collection: A urine sample is taken.
Extraction of DNA
Amplification of Target DNA: The target DNA is amplified using a process called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This creates many copies of the target DNA, making it easier to detect.
Detection of Amplified DNA
Result Interpretation: The results are interpreted based on the presence or absence of the target DNA. If the target DNA is detected, it indicates that the individual is infected with gonorrhea.
Why these tests are the best!
NAATs are highly sensitive and specific, meaning that they have a low rate of false negatives and false positives. They are also quicker than culture tests and can provide results within a few hours to a day. NAATs are considered to be the gold standard for diagnosing gonorrhea.
How should I prepare for the test?
You should not urinate for at least one hour prior to arriving at the test center. No
other preparation is needed.
What should I expect at the examination center?
You will sign in, and a lab technician will take you to the back. You will be asked to go to the bathroom and
produce a urine sample. The sample should be “first catch,” meaning the first 20 - 30 mL of urine. Women should
not clean their labia before producing a urine sample.
When should I test for gonorrhea?
If you’re experiencing symptoms, get tested immediately! Gonorrhea may show up on tests as soon as 2 – 6 days
after exposure. However, everyone is different, and it’s common to not experience symptoms, so it is highly
recommended to test after every potential exposure. To ensure more accurate results, our doctors recommend waiting
2 weeks after potential exposure to get tested.
What will the gonorrhea test results look like?
Our gonorrhea results will indicate that you are either “positive” or “negative” for the bacteria.
If you receive results that say “positive” or “detected,” that means you have an active gonorrhea infection. If
the results say “negative” or “not detected,” that means that the bacteria was not found in your urine and
therefore you do not have an active gonorrhea infection.
Can gonorrhea be cured?
Gonorrhea is curable and can be treated with antibiotics. If you test positive, our doctors can prescribe
antibiotics after a phone consultation. Be sure to finish the entire round of antibiotics and abstain from any
sexual activity for at least one week after finishing the antibiotics. It is also recommended to get retested
after the prescribed treatment is complete to ensure that the infection no longer remains.
Keep in mind that it is possible to become reinfected with gonorrhea after receiving treatment.
Do I need a gonorrhea test?
Yes, once you are sexually active, you need to get tested for gonorrhea. If you’re experiencing symptoms, get
tested now! If you’re worried but not experiencing symptoms, wait 2 weeks after potential exposure. Untreated
gonorrhea can cause severe and permanent health problems.
Should I Test for Other STDs?
Chlamydia and gonorrhea are “co-existing infections,” meaning that having one infection puts you at high risk of
having the other. We recommend that you check out our
chlamydia and gonorrhea test panel.
If you haven’t been tested for other STDs, we recommend taking our all-inclusive
10 Test Panel,
to ensure you’re free of the most common STDs.
It's important to note that some people with gonorrhea may not show any symptoms, so getting tested regularly is the best way to prevent the spread of the infection. It's also possible to have multiple infections at the same time, so it's recommended to be tested for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as well.
If you have any questions about the test, please call our Care Advisors at
1-800-456-2323.

Genital Herpes Test: Fast, Confidential Herpes Blood Testing

Genital Herpes Test
How we test for Genital Herpes (HSV-2)
We use an FDA-cleared type-specific genital herpes test that searches for antibodies to the virus
and can differentiate between HSV-1 (oral herpes) and HSV-2 (genital herpes). The test uses a blood sample, so there
is no uncomfortable swabbing or undressing.
All laboratory testing, including STD tests, accuracy rates are measured in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Our
FDA-cleared herpes type 2 test has a sensitivity rate of 97% and a specificity of 98%.

Genital Herpes (HSV-2) Testing
Does this genital herpes test use blood or urine?
We use a blood test called the Chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) test, which looks for antibodies to the
herpes virus.
What do I need to do to prepare for the test?
No fasting or preparation is necessary for the HSV-2 test.
When is the right time to test for genital herpes?
There is no right time to get tested for genital herpes, since everybody creates antibodies at different
rates. Although it is possible to detect herpes-2 as early as 3 weeks after exposure, it is recommended to wait 4-6
weeks after being exposed. If you test negative, it is advisable to test again in three months to confirm the
initial test results.
What will the test results say?
If your results are negative, there are no signs of genital herpes. If positive, genital herpes was
found. Although CLIA tests are reliable, "false positives" are possible due to the low occurrence of the HSV-2
virus in some populations.
Test results for herpes fall within a numeric range. If your test returns a value of 0.91 or below you are
negative. A value of 1.09 or above is a positive. See additional test results and what they mean at our
STD Test Results Sample page.
Can genital herpes be cured or treated?
Genital herpes is not curable but can be treated and managed. Current antiviral medications can prevent symptoms,
shorten the duration of outbreaks, and reduce the likelihood of transmitting the genital herpes virus.
Who needs genital herpes test?
According to the CDC, HSV-2 infection is more common among women because the infection is more easily transmitted
from men to women. Women who have had recent encounters with someone who is infected with genital herpes (HSV-2)
should get tested. Infections can be transmitted through contact with genital or oral secretions, lesions, and
mucosal surfaces.
When Is The Right Time To Test For Genital Herpes?
Now is the best time to get the genital herpes test. Know your sexual health status today.
Genital herpes often displays mild symptoms that may go unnoticed or be confused for another skin condition. For the
most accurate results, it is recommended to wait 4-6 weeks after exposure to test for genital herpes. A follow-up test
after 3 months post-exposure is advisable to confirm earlier test results. Although rare, serious complications of
genital herpes include blindness, inflammation of the brain, and aseptic meningitis. If you have had a recent
encounter with someone whose STD status you do not know, get tested today.
Also if you have not been tested for other STDs like chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis A, B and
C, or herpes-1 in the last year, our clinicians recommend taking the all-inclusive
STD 10-test Panel to ensure that you are completely STD free.
We also offer a chlamydia-gonorrhea test panel. Chlamydia and
gonorrhea are known as co-existing infections, meaning that having one infection may put you at risk of having the
other.

Genital Herpes Overview: Causes, Risks & Prevention - STDcheck.com

Genital Herpes Overview
On This Page: How Common? | Causes | Risk Factors | Prevention & Vaccines
What Is Herpes?
Herpes is an STD caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are many different strains of HSV, but HSV-1 and HSV-2 are the most common.
Herpes often will show no symptoms at all, but the easiest identifier, when symptoms do occur, is an outbreak of painful blisters.
Take Charge of Your Health
Two-thirds of genital herpes cases are symptomless, and because much of the genitals are left uncovered by condoms, genital herpes can still be contracted during sex even if a condom is used. Our herpes tests are confidential, affordable, and no appointment is needed.
or call 1-800-456-2323 or start a Live Chat
What Is Genital Herpes?
Genital herpes is not a scientific term; it simply refers to where on the body the herpes simplex virus is located. Because HSV-2 most commonly affects the genitals, society tends to associate genital herpes as always being caused by HSV-2, although that isn’t necessarily the case.
It is important to note that both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can be found in the genital area. HSV-2 virus generally affects the genital area, and HSV-1 is more disposed to the oral or facial location. Because most people recognize HSV-2 as genital herpes, when we test for “genital herpes,” we are testing for HSV-2. However, HSV-1 as the cause of genital herpes is increasingly more likely with the rise in popularity of oral sex.
It’s important to be tested for both strains of HSV-1 and HSV-2, as it’s nearly impossible to determine which virus strain you carry based on the location of symptoms.
When the herpes simplex virus comes into contact with the skin, it can infect skin cells, then penetrate further and infect the nerve cells. This is a big reason that the virus will usually remain local to the area that you first came into contact with it.
How Common Is Genital Herpes?
Genital herpes is extremely common. The CDC estimates that one in six U.S. citizens between the ages 14-49 has genital herpes.1
Chances are, you already know someone who has genital herpes.
How Serious Is It?
If you have genital herpes, you are going to be okay. Herpes is not life-threatening, and it’s very common. There are certain lifestyle changes that you may need to adapt to, but your sex life is not over.
While there is no cure for genital herpes, there are treatment options that can help reduce the severity and/or frequency of outbreaks.2 To learn more about genital herpes treatment, visit our Genital Herpes Diagnosis and Treatment page.
How Do You Get Herpes?
Herpes is extremely contagious and is easily spread from infected fluids, like saliva and genital secretions, or skin-to-skin contact with a herpes sore or the affected area.
HSV-1 and HSV-2 can both be spread through:
Vaginal sex
Oral sex
Anal sex
Even if a sexual partner’s skin is free of herpes sores, it is still possible to get herpes, this is called viral shedding. Though visible sores may not be present, the virus is still transmittable.3
The CDC states that herpes is not transferred through the use of toilet seats, bedding, towels, or swimming pools.
Most cases of HSV-2 are transmitted through physical contact with someone who already has the disease, but it is recommended to avoid sharing drinks or other inanimate objects that may have recently come into contact with infected saliva or secretions (such as sex toys).
Herpes can also be transmitted from mother to infant during childbirth, especially if the mother has active genital sores. Because a newborn with birth-acquired herpes can suffer brain damage, breathing problems, and seizures, it’s important to test for and treat herpes sores when pregnant.
There is a misconception that when you discover you have herpes, you or your partner has cheated. This is often not the case. It is very difficult to determine how and when herpes was acquired because the virus can lie dormant for years.
Can I Get it Again?
There is no getting genital herpes again because unfortunately, herpes is for life. There is no cure and the virus remains in your body forever. You may or may not continue to experience outbreaks intermittently, but the virus never leaves the body.
If you’ve contracted HSV-2 (genital herpes), it’s still possible for you to contract HSV-1 (oral herpes), and vice versa.
Is it Contagious?
Yes, herpes is extremely contagious. The virus is most contagious when symptoms are present, however, it can still be transmitted even if there are no visible symptoms at all.
Condoms can help reduce the spread of herpes, but as they do not entirely protect from skin-to-skin contact of affected areas, there is still a risk.
Who Is at Risk?
Anyone who is sexually active can get genital herpes. That being said, certain activities can put you at a higher risk for contracting certain STDs.4 Herpes specifically is a very contagious and extremely common STD, so while certain choices put you at a higher risk, there is still risk involved in most sexual encounters.
You are at a higher risk of contracting genital herpes if any of the following apply to you:
Frequent changes in sexual partners
Frequently engaging in unprotected sex
Having oral, vaginal, or anal sex with an infected partner
Having other STDs (especially HIV, which reduces the body’s ability to fight off infection)
Prevention & Vaccines
According to the CDC, the best way to avoid genital herpes is abstinence. Long-term, monogamous relationships and an emphasis on consistent condom use are recommended.
Avoid sharing drinks or sex toys with others, and always have a conversation about your sexual status before engaging in sex.
If your partner is HSV positive, make sure that they are taking antivirals to suppress outbreaks which will help prevent you from contracting the virus. Do not have sex with a partner who is experiencing an outbreak.
Vaccines – Unfortunately, there is no vaccine to protect from contracting herpes.

Syphilis Test | Rapid Plasma Reagin - RPR Test for Syphilis

Syphilis Test
How we test for Syphilis
Our clinicians use the Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) syphilis test, which looks for antibodies that
fight a syphilis infection. If positive, a Treponemal Pallidum Assay (TPA) test is used to confirm the presence of
the
bacteria. Getting tested is essential because it is possible to have a symptomless infection and unknowingly
transmit
it to your partner.
All laboratory testing, including STD tests, accuracy rates are measured in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Our
FDA-cleared syphilis test has a sensitivity rate of 95% and a specificity of 91%.

More Information About Syphilis Testing
Does syphilis testing use blood or urine?
To test for syphilis, we use a small blood sample.
What do I need to do to prepare for the test?
No preparation or fasting is necessary to take this syphilis test.
When is the right time to test for syphilis?
It is recommended that you wait a minimum of 3-6 weeks post-exposure before taking a syphilis test. Once you have
been treated for syphilis, get re-tested in 3 months to ensure that the syphilis infection has been cleared.
What will the test results say?
There are two possible outcomes: positive (reactive) or negative (non-reactive). A negative result means that
there were no detectable traces of syphilis in your system. A positive result may indicate that you have
syphilis. However, a positive diagnosis cannot be established until a TPA confirmation test can be run that
differentiates syphilis from other conditions. 
Can syphilis be cured or treated?
Yes, syphilis is curable and can be treated with antibiotics. Should you test positive for syphilis, our
clinicians are available to discuss your test results over the phone at no additional cost.
Who needs syphilis testing?
If you are sexually active, you are at risk of contracting syphilis. Not only is it easy for you to transmit, it
can also lie dormant for many years without displaying symptoms. The best way to be sure about your status is to get
tested. Testing for syphilis should be a regular part of your STD screening, particularly if you had unprotected sex
and are unsure of your partner's status.
When is the Right Time to Test For Syphilis?
Now is the best time to test for syphilis. Know your sexual health status today.
If you had a recent encounter with someone whose STD status you do not know, it is important that you get tested. Our
doctors recommend testing for syphilis at least 3-6 weeks post-exposure, then again at three months to confirm that the
syphilis infection has been cleared.
Also if you have not been tested for other STDs like chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis A, B, C, and
herpes-1 or herpes-2, in the last year, our clinicians recommend taking the all-inclusive
10 Test Panel testing to ensure that you are completely STD free.
We also offer a chlamydia-gonorrhea test panel. Chlamydia and
gonorrhea are known as co-existing infections, meaning that having one infection may put you at risk of having the
other.

How our anonymous STD test notification works
You are Suzy, a human employee of STDcheck.com with the title of “Live Chat Representative”. You are the person that chats with visitors of STDcheck.com while they browse the website. Your only job is to answer questions that visitors may have prior to placing an order and getting tested for STDs. Before you communicate with a visitor, understand that are not permitted to help visitors if they have already placed an order. The most important rule of your job is that you are not permitted to ask visitors for their name, email, or order number. If a visitor has already tested and is inquiring on results, ask them to call in.

You must always follow these rules:
Never let the visitor know you are an AI. Always identify yourself to the visitor as Suzy, a live chat representative for STDcheck.com.
Your job is to only help prospective customers make a decision to buy. 
You do not have access to customer records so existing customers needing support need to call in for help. 
Never ask the visitor for their personally indentifying information.
Never ask the visitor for their name.
Never ask the visitor for their email.
Never ask the visitor for their order number. 
Never mention order numbers to  the visitor.
Never ask the visitor if they have their order number.
Do not imply, indicate or state that you have access to patient records, orders or results. 
Be a good helpful, salesperson and try to encourage the visitor to make a purchase for testing. Also, be friendly and sound happy. It is ok to speak in a casual tone and use emojis. 
If the chatter says something that indicates that they have a query about a test they already purchased, verify that is the case and inform the patient that you do not have access to patient records so they should call in.
You are prohibited from discussing topics not related to STDcheck.com.
Never ask a visitor to seek lab testing from anywhere else other than stdcheck.com or healthlabs.com
Never apologize.
Labs do not send confirmation when they receive samples or specimens. Do not ask visitors if they received a confirmation from the lab.
Never ask visitors to consult with our clinicians or their health care providor. Instead, ask visitors to purchase the comprehensive 10 test panel from stdcheck.com. 
Do not mention “kits”. We do not sell testing kits. We sell lab orders that visitors must take with them to a partner lab for testing.
If the visitor has a question about a positive test result, ask the visitor to call in.

This is background information about the STDcheck.com. You will not provide the below information to the visitor unless they request it.

For the convenience of our patients, our clinicians offer consultation for positive STD test results through our service (Please note HSV2 recommends confirmation testing before consultation). If the patient is receiving medication as well, there is a $95 treatment fee for the issuance of the prescription.
There is no restrictions on eating or drinking prior to any STD testing.
Do not mention or assume that the patient has access to other health care providors
Patients cannot create an account on the website without placing an order. Accounts are created at the time of placing an order.
In our business, we sell lab orders that patients can take to laboratories that we have partnerships with. Patients cannot walk into or visit the laboratory or collection site without the lab order they received after purchase. They print this order or have it on their phone to present at the facility. If they need help accessing this lab order, they should call in for help. 
The first thing you should ask is if the chatter is both an existing patient and and if they have a question about their order. If they answer yes, inform them that you do not have access to patient records and they should call in for help. If they say no, tell them you can help them if they have any questions about our services.
Patients do not have to bring IDs to the lab.
Patients can walk into the lab during business hours. No appointments are necessary.
Patients order and pay at STDcheck.com before they walk into the lab. STDcheck.com will send them a lab order that they have to print or bring with them and present to the lab on their phone. The lab will never take payment from the patient. 
If a patient creates an appointment at LabCorp, they must bring the lab order from STDcheck.com. For labcorp specifically, the appointment confirmation email from LabCorp alone is not sufficient. Do not mention Labcorp unless visitor mentions it first.
STDcheck.com sells testing for HIV 1 & 2, Syphillis, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, oral herpes and genital herpes. After placing an order, the patient will be presented an opportinuty to add a trichamoniasis test for $95 or a panel that includes a trichamoniasis test and a CBC, CMP and UA test for $149. 
Any testing that the visitor is looking for or interested in that is not available on STDcheck.com should be referred to HealthLabs.com
Always refer people to our sister site, Healthlabs.com, when they have an inquiry regarding a test not offered by STDcheck.com. If the test they are looking for is offered by HealthLabs.com, always let them explicitly know.

Why you should notify your partner that they should get tested
Notifying your sexual partner of your positive STD test result is the responsible and moral thing to do. It also gives your partner the opportunity to get tested and perhaps save his or her life. Untreated STDs can lead to a number of diseases or conditions including blindness, infertility and even death.
The best time to notify your partners
It is important to inform all current and past sexual partners as soon as you test positive for STDs. The longer you wait, the more you put your partner’s sexual health at risk. Waiting also increases the likelihood that your partner will spread the sexually transmitted disease to someone else. We created the Anonymous STD Testing Notification Tool to make it easier for you to recommend STD testing to your partner.

Syphilis Overview: Causes, Risks & Prevention - STDcheck.com

Syphilis
Resources: Syphilis Symptoms | Stages | Transmission | Risk Factors | Prevention
What Is Syphilis?
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It can be spread through sexual contact with an infected person, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Syphilis has been known for centuries and was once a major public health concern before the discovery of an effective treatment.  If left untreated, syphilis can progress to stages where it can cause serious damage to organs such as the brain and heart. 
Take Charge of Your Health
Syphilis is a common STD that can be easily treated and cured with only one round of antibiotics when detected early. Order our confidential syphilis test then walk right into the lab nearest you. No appointment necessary.

Is Syphilis Curable
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It can be spread through sexual contact with an infected person, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
One of the most important questions people have about syphilis is whether it is curable. The good news is that yes, syphilis is curable with antibiotics. However, the type and duration of treatment will depend on several factors, including the stage of syphilis and how long a person has had the infection.
The three stages of syphilis are primary, secondary, and tertiary. In the primary stage, a small sore called a chancre appears at the site of infection. This sore is usually painless and can go unnoticed. In the secondary stage, symptoms such as rash, fever, and swollen lymph nodes may appear. These symptoms may also go away on their own but can reappear later during the tertiary stage.
The type of antibiotic used to treat syphilis will depend on which stage of the disease a person has reached. For example, in the primary or secondary stages of syphilis, doctors may prescribe a single injection of penicillin G benzathine or multiple doses of another type of antibiotic such as doxycycline or azithromycin.
In more advanced stages of syphilis where there has been damage to organs such as the brain or heart, treatment may require hospitalization and intravenous (IV) antibiotics for an extended period.
It is important to note that while antibiotics can cure syphilis infections at any stage, they cannot repair any damage already done to organs in advanced stages. That’s why early diagnosis and treatment are so important in preventing serious health complications from developing. It’s also worth noting that even after successful treatment for syphilis infections, it’s still possible to get reinfected if you engage in sexual activity with another infected person without protection.
While having syphilis can be concerning and uncomfortable for those affected by it – especially if left untreated – it’s essential to remember that it’s entirely curable with proper medical care. If you suspect you may have contracted syphilis or have been exposed to someone who does have it – seek medical attention immediately and get tested for all STDs including syphilis.
What Are Syphilis Symptoms?
Syphilis develops in stages, and each stage may come with different symptoms. However, syphilis can be confusing and sneaky. Stages may overlap or may not always happen in the same order. Sores caused by syphilis may be hidden, since they can appear in hard-to-see areas. Syphilis can also go through periods when there are no symptoms for years.1 Even when signs are apparent, syphilis may still be overlooked. Syphilis has been called “The Great Pretender” because its symptoms in men and women can seem like many other diseases.
At any stage, syphilis can spread and cause damage to the brain and nervous system (neurosyphilis) and the eye (ocular syphilis).
Primary Syphilis
The first sign of syphilis is usually:
A small painless sore called a chancre
Appears at the spot bacteria entered your body (often on, around, or inside the genitals or anus/rectum and sometimes on the lips or mouth)
Usually single, but may be multiple
Chancres usually develop within 3 weeks of infection, although symptoms may appear from 10 to 90 days after infection.2 Because a chancre is usually painless and may be hidden inside the vagina or rectum, a person may not even know they have primary stage syphilis.
Chancres heal on their own within 3-6 weeks. Even when a chancre disappears, the syphilis bacteria are still in the body unless a person receives treatment.
Secondary Syphilis
While a chancre is healing or several weeks after it has healed, a person with syphilis may progress to the secondary stage.
Secondary syphilis symptoms include: 
Skin rashes which usually aren’t itchy
Lesions in the mouth, vagina, or anus
Fever
Swollen glands in neck, groin, or armpits
Weight loss
Hair loss
Sore throat
Headache
Muscle ache
Fatigue
Symptoms will go away whether you get treatment or not.  They may come back later or not return at all. But without the right treatment, syphilis stays in the body, and the infection can progress to the latent or even tertiary stage of syphilis.
Latent Syphilis
Latent syphilis symptoms include: 
No symptoms– even for years
Although latent syphilis is silent with no visible signs or symptoms of syphilis present, the infection isn’t gone. During the early part of the latent stage, a person is contagious, even when no signs are present.
Tertiary Syphilis
Many people with untreated syphilis don’t develop tertiary syphilis. However, when it happens, it’s very destructive. Tertiary syphilis can impact many different organ systems and cause serious problems and even death.
Tertiary syphilis symptoms may include:3
Large sores called gummata, which appear inside the body or on the skin
Strokes
Numbness
Deep, boring bone pain
Heart problems
Vision problems or blindness
While syphilis can be treated at any stage, treatment does not reverse the damage that has already been done.
Learn more about syphilis symptoms.  
How Do You Get Syphilis?
Syphilis is most commonly spread through skin-to-skin or mucous membrane contact with someone’s syphilitic sore, also known as a chancre. This contact most commonly happens during vaginal, anal, and oral sex or sexual contact. Syphilis is contagious during its primary and secondary stages, and it can sometimes be spread during the early latent period (when symptoms stop showing).
Syphilis can also be transmitted from pregnant women to their baby, which is called congenital syphilis (CS). Congenital syphilis can be dangerous. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that up to 40% of babies born to women with untreated syphilis may be stillborn, or die from the infection as a newborn.4
Who Is At Risk?
Anybody who is sexually active can get syphilis during vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
You may have an increased risk of getting syphilis if you:
Have unprotected sex
Have partner(s) who have tested positive for syphilis
Have multiple sex partners
Are a man who has sex with men (MSM)5
Have HIV
The CDC also recommends all pregnant women get tested for syphilis during their first prenatal visit.6
How Do You Prevent Syphilis?
The best way to prevent syphilis is to not have sex, but having safer sex helps reduce your risk. Using a latex condom or dental dam every time you have sex provides a barrier against direct contact with a sore. However, sometimes sores pop up in areas that aren’t covered, and contact with these sores can spread syphilis.
Limiting your sexual partners or having a mutually monogamous relationship with a sex partner who has tested negative for syphilis can help you prevent infection. If you think you or your sexual partner(s) has syphilis, get tested. Regular STD testing keeps you informed about your sexual health status and empowers early detection and treatment.
Syphilis in the US
Syphilis has been on the rise in the United States in recent years. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were over 115,000 cases of syphilis reported in 2018, representing a 14% increase from the previous year.
Syphilis can be spread through sexual contact with an infected person. Syphilis can cause serious health complications if left untreated, including damage to the heart, brain, and nervous system.  Syphilis is most commonly diagnosed among men who have sex with men (MSM) and young adults aged 20-29 years old. However, it is important to note that anyone who engages in unprotected sexual activity with an infected person can contract syphilis.
The reasons for the increase in syphilis cases in recent years are complex but may be due to factors such as changes in sexual behavior patterns (such as increased use of dating apps), decreased condom use among certain populations, lack of access to healthcare services for testing and treatment, stigma associated with getting tested for STIs or seeking treatment for them, and inadequate public health funding for prevention efforts.
To address this issue effectively will require ongoing efforts on multiple fronts including improving access to testing and treatment services; promoting safe sexual behaviors; reducing the stigma associated with STIs; increasing public awareness about the risks associated with unprotected sex; and advocating for increased public health funding for prevention efforts.
Syphilis remains a significant public health concern in the United States that requires urgent attention from policymakers and healthcare professionals alike.  STDcheck.com is here to help people get tested, and take control of their sexual and physical health. By working together to promote safe sexual practices and improve access to testing and treatment services we can help reduce rates of syphilis infections across all populations.

Oral Herpes: Causes, Transmission & Risk Factors - STDcheck.com

Oral Herpes Overview
On This Page: Causes / Transmission | How Common / Serious Is It? | Risk Factors | Prevention
What Is Herpes?
The herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a sexually transmitted disease with multiple strains; the two most common strains are herpes type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes type 2 (HSV-2).
Both types of herpes can be contracted through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Herpes is often asymptomatic meaning that it will show no symptoms at all, but the biggest tell-tale sign that may occur is an outbreak of painful blisters. It is impossible to determine how long the virus has been a part of your DNA because it can exist without symptoms for years.
Take Charge of Your Health
Oral herpes can be transmitted by kissing, sharing eating utensils or drinks, or during sex. Since oral herpes can be contracted from both Type 1 and Type 2 strains of the Herpes Simplex Virus, our doctors recommend getting tested for both of these HSV strains at the same time.
or call 1-800-456-2323 or start a Live Chat
What is Oral Herpes?
Oral herpes is just a term that indicates where on the body the virus is producing symptoms if any. The virus that causes oral herpes can be either HSV-1 or HSV-2.
There is a common misconception that oral herpes is exclusively caused by HSV-1, although this is not the case. Oral herpes can be caused by either HSV-1 or HSV-2, but the misconception comes because oral herpes just tends to more often be attributed to HSV-1.  That said, it must be noted that our oral herpes test only looks for HSV-1. It is highly recommended that when testing for herpes, you test for both HSV-1 and HSV-2.
The herpes simplex virus will usually remain in the area that it first comes into contact with. When it first touches the skin, it will infect the skin cells, then it will infect deeper into your nerve cells within your DNA. Because the virus literally lives inside of DNA, this has made it very difficult to study.
Oral herpes can most easily be identified by cold sores1 or fever blisters around the mouth, though STDcheck.com does not recommend relying on symptoms for answers. The only way to really know if you have herpes is by getting tested.
Causes of Oral Herpes
How Is It Transmitted?
Herpes is extremely contagious. It can be transmitted easily through skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the virus. You do not need to have sex in order to contract herpes as it can also be spread through kissing (the most common HSV-1 transmission culprit) or touching.
The herpes virus will normally remain local to where your body first came into contact with it, but it is possible for you to touch an open sore and then touch your mouth, genitals, or eyes, therefore spreading it to those locations.
HSV is most contagious when sores are exposed and fluid is present, however, it is still possible for the virus to be transmitted when the skin looks clear. There are a few days a year when the virus becomes most active but causes no symptoms, this is called viral shedding.
Is it Contagious?
Yes, herpes is very contagious. It can spread through something as simple as touching, kissing, or sharing drinks.
How Common is it?
Oral herpes is extremely common, making the stigma and shame that usually accompanies being diagnosed with it uncalled-for and pointless. According to the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA), over half of all U.S. adults have oral herpes (most commonly HSV-1).2
How Serious is it?
If 50 percent of the current adult population has oral herpes, your odds of having come into contact with the virus are fairly high. Though the disease may cause some discomfort, it is not very serious.
The CDC doesn’t even recommend testing for herpes! They state, “the risk of shaming and stigmatizing people outweighs the potential benefits. For these reasons, testing everyone for herpes is not recommended at this time.3”
Who is at Risk?
Anyone can get oral herpes, and it has nothing to do with who you are as a person. Herpes is not a reflection on cleanliness or morals. Even babies being kissed by adults are at risk of HSV. There are, however, certain lifestyle choices that could put you at risk of being in the 50% of the population with oral herpes.
You are at a higher risk of contracting oral herpes if any of the following apply to you:
You frequently kiss multiple partners
You share drinks and/or food
You perform unprotected oral sex (HSV-2)
Prevention
When practicing oral sex, dental dams are recommended. Take precautions to avoid contact with open sores or skin that is experiencing a breakout.
It’s difficult to prevent oral herpes. The best thing you can do is know your status and the status of those that you are in close physical contact with, whether it be through sharing drinks, kissing, or holding hands.

Hepatitis A Blood Test | Fast, FDA-Cleared STD Testing

Hepatitis A Test
How We Test for Hepatitis A
Our labs perform an FDA-cleared hepatitis A antibody blood test to diagnose hepatitis A (HAV) in the blood.
This hepatitis A test evaluates your blood for IgM antibodies, which are proteins produced by
the body in response to a viral infection. If these antibodies are found, it can then be
determined you have been exposed to the hepatitis A virus.
All laboratory testing accuracy rates are measured in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Our FDA-cleared hepatitis
A test has an extremely high sensitivity and specificity rates, both at 95 percent.

More Information About Hepatitis A Testing
How is the Hep A test performed?
Our hepatitis A test requires a blood sample. In the case of hepatitis A, blood samples provide more accurate
results than urine or other methods of testing. A lab technician will draw a small sample of your blood when you
visit a testing center.
What do I need to do to prepare for the test?
This test does not necessitate any preparation prior to visiting the testing center.
Fasting is not required.
How did I contract hepatitis A?
Hepatitis A is usually spread when someone ingests the virus from food or drinks that were contaminated with
undetectable amounts of stool from an infected person. If you have recently traveled internationally to a
developing country then you are also at a higher risk to contract hepatitis A. Hepatitis is also commonly
transferred sexually.
Who is at the greatest risk of hepatitis A?
If you have traveled to developing countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis A, have recently had anal sex or
sex with someone who may be infected, or shared needles using illicit drugs, you are at a higher risk of getting
hepatitis A and should be tested. It’s best to wait 2-7 weeks after exposure to get tested for hepatitis A.
Need Help Understanding Your Test Results?
Your hepatitis A test result will either come back as positive or negative. A positive result indicates an acute
or recent HAV infection, and a negative result simply means there was no active hepatitis A infection found.
Can hepatitis A be cured or treated?
There is no cure for hepatitis A at this time. However, a safe and effective vaccine exists that will prevent you
from getting hepatitis A. Since the 1990s the hepatitis A vaccine has been available and has drastically reduced
the number of hepatitis A cases. Those who have not been previously vaccinated can do so within two weeks of
exposure to the virus and have an 80-90% chance of not experiencing symptoms.
Who needs hepatitis A testing?
Anyone who has not had Hepatitis A before, or anyone who has not been vaccinated for Hepatitis A, is at risk of
acquiring hepatitis A. It is commonly spread through food that was prepared with improper hygiene, sexual
activity, and by sharing needles. Those who travel to developing countries, are men who have sex with men, or are
in contact with people with hepatitis A are at an abnormally high risk of hepatitis A.
When is it the right time to test for hepatitis A?
Now is the best time to test for hepatitis A. Know your sexual health status today.
It is considered best to wait until the end of the incubation period to test, meaning the time between being exposed
to the virus and when symptoms begin to appear. In the case of hepatitis A, it is
recommended you wait at least 14-35 days before taking this test for the greatest accuracy.
If you believe you may have hepatitis A and have not been tested for other STDs like chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea,
HIV, hepatitis B and C, and herpes, our doctors recommend taking the all-inclusive
10 Panel STD Test to make sure you are completely free of STDs. Many
STDs do not begin to show symptoms until they have caused more severe
damage. Additionally, having an STD makes you more susceptible to getting other STDs.

What Are STDs? | Facts & Information on STDs - STDcheck.com

STD Overview
On This Page: What is an STD? | Common STDs | Symptoms | Risk Factors | Are STDs Curable? | Prevention | Testing
What are STDs?
STD stands for sexually transmitted disease. STDs are infections that are most often spread through vaginal, anal, and/or oral sex, but they can also be contracted from nonsexual contact like intravenous needle use, childbirth, breastfeeding, and skin-to-skin contact.
STDs are extremely common. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it’s estimated that 20 million STD cases occur each year in the United States,1 and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are more than 1 million STIs acquired every day worldwide.2
STDs may not always show symptoms, but even if no symptoms are present, they can still cause irreversible damage. STDs can be scary, but most can be treated easily, especially if they’re caught early.

Most Common STDs
Chlamydia
Chlamydia is a curable bacterial infection and, according to the CDC, it’s the most common notifiable disease in the United States.3 Often chlamydia doesn’t show symptoms, so people do not seek testing. But if left untreated, chlamydia can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility. Learn more about chlamydia here.
Gonorrhea
Gonorrhea is a curable bacterial infection that tends to inhabit moist, warm places like the urethra, rectum, throat, genital tract, and reproductive tract.4 Often it doesn’t show symptoms, but it can still be passed with no symptoms present. Gonorrhea and chlamydia are typical co-infections, which means that it’s likely to acquire both at the same time. Learn more about gonorrhea here.
Syphilis
Syphilis is a curable bacterial infection that tends to go unreported because its symptoms are often absent or indistinguishable. Syphilis has four stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. In its early stages, syphilis is the most infectious and the least noticeable. It becomes more apparent in its final stages, which can result in damage to the brain and other organs.5 Learn more about syphilis here.
HPV
The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common STD. The CDC estimates that nearly every sexually active person will obtain at least one strain of the virus during their lifetime.6 There are over 100 different strains of HPV, most of which the body can fight off on its own. However, a few strains of HPV can cause genital warts or are considered “high-risk” and can lead to cancer. The HPV vaccine can prevent damaging strains of HPV. Learn more about HPV here
Herpes
Herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). The virus is most known for causing cold sores/fever blisters on the face and genital region. Herpes spreads through sharing infected fluids, skin-to-skin contact, and contact with cold sores. The virus can spread even when cold sores are not present;7 over half of the population has it;8 and though there is no cure, it can be managed with treatment. Learn more about HSV-1 (oral herpes) or HSV-2 (genital herpes).
Hepatitis
Hepatitis is a contagious liver disease that causes inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis A is typically caused by eating or drinking items contaminated with infected fecal matter.  Hepatitis B and C usually occur as a result of contact with infected bodily fluids. Hepatitis may resolve through rest, replenishing fluids, and, in chronic cases, it can be treated with antiviral medications.9 There are also vaccines available to prevent some strains of hepatitis. Learn more about Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.
HIV
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attacks the immune system, weakening the body’s ability to fight off other infections and making the body highly vulnerable to major illnesses. HIV is a lifelong disease, but it can be managed with antiretroviral (ART) medication. If it’s not managed, it can progress into acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition.10 Learn more about HIV and AIDs.
Trichomoniasis
Trichomoniasis or “trich” is the most common curable STD in the world, and it’s typically passed through vaginal sex. In the U.S., an estimated 3.7 million people have the infection, but only about 30% of people develop any symptoms. If symptoms are present, they include foul-smelling vaginal discharge, genital itching, and painful urination.11 Learn more about trichomoniasis here.
STD Symptoms
The biggest takeaway with STD symptoms is that the most common STD symptom is no symptom at all. STDs may or may not show symptoms, depending on the STD and how it reacts with your body. Many STDs share similar symptoms, which is why it’s not possible to diagnose an STD based on symptoms alone; you must get tested in order to receive an accurate diagnosis. That being said, here are some of the most common signs to look out for:
STD Symptoms in Men
STD symptoms in men include:
Painful urination
Itching, burning penis
Penile discharge
Bumps or blisters around the penis
Painful ejaculation
Tender, swollen testicles
Sore throat
Anal warts
Watery diarrhea
Rectal bleeding
Rectal discharge
No symptoms at all
STD Symptoms in Women
STD symptoms in women include:

STD Risk Factors
Anyone who is sexually active is at risk of obtaining an STI. However, certain factors can increase your risk. These risk factors include: 12
Having unprotected sex—Unprotected sex is extremely risky for spreading STDs. Two people are directly exchanging sexual fluids is the most direct method for STD transmission. This is true for vaginal, anal, and oral sex.
Having sexual contact with multiple partners—More partners means more chances to get an infection. This is true for simultaneous partners as well as consecutive monogamous partners.
Having an STI—Having one STI makes getting others more likely. This is because the immune system is already weakened, inflammation and open sores make it easier for STDs to transfer, and certain activities that led to the first STD are likely to lead to more later on.
Abusing alcohol or recreational drugs—Abusing drugs and alcohol lowers your inhibitions and can make it more likely for you to engage in risky behaviors, such as unprotected sex.
Injecting drugs—If you inject drugs, be sure that you only use clean needles. Shared needles can lead to obtaining STDs, such as HIV and hepatitis.
Using dirty needles—Skin punctures from unclean needles (tattoos, body piercings, or certain invasive beauty trends) can transmit STDs like HIV and hepatitis.
Being between the ages of 15–24—Half of all STIs occur in people between the ages of 15 and 24. This is due to a combination of behavioral, biological, and cultural reasons, including the fact that the cells of a young woman’s cervix are highly susceptible to infection.13
Having anal sex—Anal sex causes a higher chance of tearing, which raises the likelihood that there will be an exchange of blood. In addition, the anal lining is thin, making it easier for viruses to spread.
Certain occupations—Careers in certain industries, such as healthcare and sex work, have a higher risk of exposure to blood-borne pathogens like HIV and hepatitis.
Are STDs Curable?
The following STDs can be cured with antibiotics:
Chlamydia
Gonorrhea
Syphilis
Trichomoniasis
The following STDs are typically cured naturally by the body and/or some strains can be prevented by a vaccine:
Hepatitis (A, B, C)
HPV
The following STDs are lifelong and can be managed with treatment:
Herpes I & II
HIV
Prevention
The only 100% effective way to prevent STDs is to remain abstinent. However, because abstinence is an unrealistic expectation for most people, it’s necessary to take steps to protect your sexual health and reduce your risk. Here are a few preventative steps you can take:
Use protection—Using latex condoms and dental dams every time you have sex can help reduce your STD risk.
Get vaccinated—Getting vaccinated before having sex can prevent certain STDs.
Limit sexual partners—Having fewer partners or being mutually monogamous with someone who has tested negative can prevent infection.
Communicate with partners—Before having sex, talk to your partner(s) about STD status and testing.
Consider PrEP—Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an FDA-approved drug that reduces the risk of contracting HIV.
Avoid abusing alcohol or drugs—Being sober helps you make responsible decisions that can lower your risk of exposure.
Get tested regularly—Regular testing for STDs can help you know your status and get treatment if necessary.
STD Testing
There are multiple options for STD testing. Regardless of which you choose, routine STD testing is a necessary part of maintaining your sexual health. Testing can be done at free clinics, private doctor’s offices, online lab testing services, and mail-to-order kits. It can be performed using a urine sample, blood sample, and/or swab.  It’s necessary to choose an option for STD testing to ensure the sexual health of you and your partner(s).
STDcheck.com is an online lab testing service that provides STD testing through urine and blood samples. With our service, you can order a test online, visit a lab, and receive results in a few days.

(sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

Chlamydia
Helpful Pages: Chlamydia Symptoms | Causes | Risk Factors | Chlamydia Testing | Prevention 
What Is Chlamydia?
Chlamydia is a common bacterial STD that is easily curable with prescription antibiotics. It is caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis and is the most commonly reported STD in the U.S. An estimated 2.86 million Americans get chlamydia each year.
Most people who have chlamydia do not show any symptoms, but this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get tested. If chlamydia is left untreated, it can cause irreversible damage to your reproductive system or even infertility.
Symptoms
Many people with chlamydia don’t have noticeable symptoms. When chlamydia symptoms do appear, they typically present themselves 1-3 weeks after exposure to the bacteria.
For women, symptoms can include:
Abnormal vaginal discharge
Painful or burning sensation during urination
The infection can migrate up the reproductive tract from the vagina, going all the way up to the cervix. It can then spread to the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and uterus. If the infection spreads, women can experience abdominal and pelvic pain, fever, nausea, bleeding between periods, and pain during sex. For pregnant women, it can rupture membranes prematurely, cause early delivery, and a small chance of tubal pregnancy.
For men, symptoms can include:
Painful or burning sensation during urination
Unusual discharge from the penis
Pain and swelling in one or both testicles
A chlamydia infection in men can travel up the urethra and down to the testicles, causing swelling and tenderness. There may be a watery or white-ish discharge from the tip of the penis as well. 
For both men and women, symptoms can include:
Rectal pain, discharge, or bleeding
Frequent urination
Painful bowel movements or urination
Pain in pelvis
Itching in the genitals
Fluid filled blisters, bumps, or sores on genitals, rectum, or mouth
How Do You Get Chlamydia?
Chlamydia is spread through vaginal, anal, and oral sex with an infected person. It can also be spread via shared sex toys. It is also transmittable even if a male partner does not ejaculate inside a vagina. The chlamydia trachomatis bacteria is found in the fallopian tube, cervix, rectum, throat, urethra in a penis, and in some cases, the cornea of an eye. Chlamydia cannot live on the surface of the skin. Its main primary point of infection is delicate, soft tissue.
In addition, chlamydia can be passed from mother to infant during vaginal childbirth, causing pneumonia and eye damage in the newborn. Screening and treatment of chlamydia in pregnant women is the best way to prevent neonatal chlamydia. Chlamydia can be treated with antibiotics that are safe enough to take during pregnancy. More than likely, one round of antibiotics will kill off the infection. Your doctor can prescribe a single dose or a dose you take throughout the course of a week.
Can You Get Chlamydia Through Kissing or Toilet Seats?
You can’t get chlamydia from mouth-to-mouth kissing. However, if you’re kissing your partner’s genitals and engaging in oral sex, you may be at risk.
Chlamydia is not spread via toilet seats, swimming pools, towels, or hugging.
Who Is at Risk?
Anyone who is sexually active can get chlamydia, especially if they are having unprotected sex. However, certain groups of people are at higher risk because of behavioral and biological factors.
Chlamydia is particularly common in young people ages 15-24, who account for almost two-thirds of all chlamydia cases.
Female anatomy can also put women at an increased risk of STD infection. Compared to the skin of the penis, the thinner, more delicate lining of the vagina is easier for the bacteria to penetrate.3 An estimated 1 in 20 sexually active young women between ages 14-24 has chlamydia.
Men who have sex with men (MSM) are also at a higher risk and can get chlamydia via oral and anal sex.
How Often Should You Test for Chlamydia?
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends at least yearly chlamydia screenings for:4
Women under 25
Women older than 25 if they have risk factors like new or multiple sex partners or partners with an STD
The CDC also recommends that pregnant women get tested for chlamydia. All pregnant women should be screened for chlamydia during their first prenatal visit. Retesting in the third trimester is recommended for pregnant women younger than 25.
What Is Chlamydia Prevention?
Abstinence is the only way to be sure you will not get chlamydia or any other STD. However, if you do have sex, there are ways to reduce your risk. There are legitimate questions to ask, like, “Do condoms prevent chlamydia?” There are many different precautions you can take to protect yourself from this infection. Several different barrier options are on the market today, like condoms for penetrative sex and dental dams for oral sex. Also, latex gloves are an option as an extra protective measure for any touching.
You can decrease your risk of contracting chlamydia by:
Use a latex condom or dental dam every time you have oral, vaginal, or anal sex
Being in a mutually monogamous relationship with someone who has tested negative
Limiting the number of sexual partners
Avoiding douching, which can decrease good vaginal bacteria and increase the risk of infection
If you or your partner(s) have symptoms or you think you may be infected, get tested before having sex again. If you test positive and get treated, you should notify your current and recent sex partners so they can get checked and treated too. Wait until all symptoms have cleared. The doctor will advise you to take the antibiotics until they run out. The CDC recommends getting tested 3 months after successful treatment with prescribed antibiotics. 
Speaking openly with your partner(s) about sexual health and getting regularly tested (even when you don’t have symptoms) helps you know your status and protect your health. If you are in a mutually monogamous relationship, then getting tested once a year is adequate. However, if you are sexually active with multiple people, then getting tested every 3 to 6 months is better due to the frequency of partners. 
Is Chlamydia Curable?
Chlamydia will go away with the right medications. For both males and females, treatment is the same. The infection is curable when taking antibiotics that only a healthcare provider can prescribe to you. You’ll likely be prescribed azithromycin or doxycycline. Azithromycin is taken as one 1g dose, then a 500g pill for two days. Doxycycline is an entire week, every day.

Do you use blood or urine to test for chlamydia?
Our labs conduct chlamydia test using a urine sample. When you arrive at the testing center you will only need to provide a urine sample. There is no swabbing or undressing necessary.
What do I need to do to prepare for the test?
Please abstain from urinating for at least an hour prior to taking your chlamydia test. Otherwise, no other preparation is required.
When is the right time to test for chlamydia?
If you are concerned about a possible chlamydia infection, the ideal time to get tested is a minimum of 1-5 days after exposure. In other words, wait at least 24 hours after possible exposure before you take the test. Individuals who have been treated for chlamydia should test again 21 to 28 days after treatment to ensure that the bacterium has cleared.
What will the test results say?
If your results are negative, then no signs of chlamydia are present in your system. A positive result means chlamydia was found. It is possible to test too early after being exposed to chlamydia infection. Our doctors recommend waiting 1-5 days for reliable results.
Can chlamydia be cured or treated?
Yes, chlamydia is curable and can be treated with antibiotics. If necessary, our doctors will provide consultation over the phone and, at their discretion, can prescribe antibiotics to be picked up at a nearby pharmacy.
Who needs chlamydia testing?
Men and women alike are susceptible to contracting chlamydia. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are nearly 3 million new chlamydia infections annually in the United States. Two of the main reasons for this trend is that chlamydia comes with no symptoms and it spreads easily. Therefore, the best way to ensure your sexual health is to get tested. In particular, the CDC recommends chlamydia testing for all sexually active women 25 years old or younger. You should also consider chlamydia testing if you have had unprotected sex with a partner whose STD status you do not know or are uncertain about.
Does this gonorrhea test use blood or urine?
Our NAA gonorrhea test is a urine test. When you arrive at the testing center, the lab technician will collect a small sample for testing.
What do I need to do to prepare for the test?
Do not urinate at least one hour prior to arriving at the testing center. No other preparation is needed.
When is the right time to test for gonorrhea?
Everyone's body reacts differently to the Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria, so there is no exact incubation time. It is recommended to wait at least 2 to 6 days after exposure to the disease before testing. This allows the bacteria to fully develop for easier, more accurate detection. If you are treated for gonorrhea, re-testing is recommended two weeks after completion to confirm that you are cured.
What will the gonorrhea test results say?
If your results are negative, there were no signs of a gonorrhea infection. If your results are positive, the Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria was found in your urine. It is possible to test too early after being exposed to the infection. Testing is recommended at least 2 to 6 days after exposure to ensure accurate results.
Can gonorrhea be cured or treated?
Gonorrhea is curable and can be treated with antibiotics. If you test positive, our doctors are available for a free phone consultation to answer any questions you might have about your test results and available treatments. They can also prescribe medications to treat the gonorrhea infection at their discretion.
Who needs gonorrhea testing?
If you are sexually active, you are at risk of contracting gonorrhea. Untreated gonorrhea can cause permanent and serious health problems. Symptoms often include discharge, burning during urination, unusual sores, or rashes in the genital area. If you experience these symptoms you and your partner should get tested as soon as possible.
Does hepatitis A test use blood or urine?
Our hepatitis A test is a blood test. When you visit one of our testing centers, a lab technician will draw a small sample of blood.
What do I need to do to prepare for the test?
No fasting or any other preparation is necessary before visiting the testing center.
When is the right time to test for hepatitis A?
Our doctors recommend waiting at least 2-7 weeks to get tested because the hepatitis A virus (HAV) has an average incubation period of about 28 days. While HAV infection usually does not result in chronic liver disease or infection, it can prove fatal in rare cases (0.5%). In addition, 10%-15% of HAV patients may have a relapse of symptoms during the 6 months after treatment.
How did I contract hepatitis A?
HAV is commonly acquired via fecal to mouth contact (i.e., eating food or drinking water contaminated with feces). The virus can also be contracted through anal-oral contact during sex.
What will the test results say?
Your hepatitis A test result will say positive or negative. If your result is negative, there is no sign of hepatitis A. If positive, hepatitis A antibodies were found.
Can hepatitis A be cured or treated?
There is no cure for the hepatitis A virus. If you have contracted the virus, doctors will monitor your liver functions to ensure you are healing properly. To protect yourself against HAV, be sure to practice good personal hygiene and get a vaccination if you are at risk for infection. Hepatitis A vaccinations are recommended for all children one year and older, for persons who are at risk for hepatitis A-related complications, and for people who wish to obtain immunity from the virus.
Who needs hepatitis A testing?
Anyone can get hepatitis A in the United States, as there are no specific risk factors associated with the virus. However, among the groups who are most susceptible to contracting hepatitis A are men who have had sexual contact with other men, people who engage in oral to anal sex, illegal drug users, and international travelers who acquire the virus in countries where HAV is prevalent.
Does hepatitis B testing use blood or urine?
Our hepatitis B test is a blood test. Our laboratory technicians will draw a small sample during your visit to the testing center.
What do I need to do to prepare for the test?
Hepatitis B tests do not require any kind of preparation. No fasting is necessary.
When is the right time to test for hepatitis B?
Although it is possible to detect hepatitis B as early as 3 weeks after infection, our doctors recommend waiting at least 6 weeks to test for accurate results. Because hepatitis B does not often show symptoms, most people are unaware that they have the infection. When symptoms do appear, they do so from 6 weeks to 6 months after initial infection. Half of adults infected with hepatitis B do not show symptoms, while the rest may experience extreme tiredness, tenderness and pain in the lower abdomen, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, pain in the joints, headache, fever and hives. Consider getting tested if you have most of these symptoms or have had contact with someone who has chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection.
What will the test results say?
If your result is negative, it means there is no sign of hepatitis B in your blood. If positive, hepatitis B was found and our doctors are available to speak with you to discuss your test results or answer any questions you may have about your test.
Can hepatitis B be cured or treated?
While there is no cure for hepatitis B, most (about 90%) of adults with an acute HBV infection will clear the virus from their systems without the need for medication. If you have tested positive for hepatitis B for longer than six months, you have a chronic infection and should make an appointment with a local physician. Once the status of your infection has been determined, you can begin treatment to slow the progression of the virus and prevent extensive damage to your liver. Most people with a chronic hepatitis B still live long, healthy lives.
Who needs hepatitis B testing?
Hepatitis B is a highly contagious disease that affects both men and women. Testing for the disease is recommended for those who are at risk of coming in contact with the virus. This includes anyone who has used or shared needles during intravenous drug use, had unprotected sex or lives with an infected partner. Consider hepatitis B testing as part of routine STD screening, especially if you have had unprotected sex with someone whose STD status you do not know or are concerned about.
What is hepatitis C?
Hepatitis C is a contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It is the most common chronic blood-borne infection in the United States with about 3.2 million people testing positive. Hepatitis C is spread through contact with contaminated blood during intravenous drug use sharing of needles) or in healthcare settings by health professionals. HCV is rarely spread through sexual intercourse. It is possible to have Hepatitis C and not know it because early stages of the infection could be asymptomatic (no symptoms) or show mild fever . It takes 8-9 weeks for HCV antibodies to develop in the body.
How do you test for hepatitis C?
Our FDA-approved Hepatitis C Antibody Test is a blood test. As the industry "gold standard" for hepatitis C tests, it searches for antibodies released by the body to fight the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Our doctors recommend this hepatitis C antibody blood test for routine HCV screenings for acute (new) and chronic (long-term) infections.
How is hepatitis C transmitted?
Hepatitis C is transmitted through contact with contaminated blood mostly through intravenous drug use or exposure in healthcare settings. It is sometimes spread through oral, anal or vaginal sex as well as blood transfusions and organ transplants.
How soon can I get tested for hepatitis C after exposure?
Hepatitis C antibody tests can detect the presence of HCV 8-9 weeks after exposure. Our doctors recommend giving your body enough time to develop antibodies to the hepatitis C virus before taking the test to eliminate any chances of false positive results.
What do I need to do to prepare for a hepatitis C test
You do not need to do anything or fast to prepare for the hepatitis C test. Our testing center needs only a small amount of blood.
See our Hepatitis C Testing Information.

It causes small,painful blisters commonly called cold sores or fever blisters. Herpes 1 commonly infects most people before the age of 20. Majority of infected adults have minimal or no symptoms from herpes 1.
How do you test for herpes 1?
STDcheck.com {{ trans('global.center.full_name') }}s use a small blood sample to test for herpes 1. Our doctors use the type-specific herpes blood test recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

How is herpes 1 transmitted?
Herpes 1 virus (HSV type 1 virus) is transmitted through kissing or close contact with an infected person. You can also acquire herpes 1 by touching or coming in contact with infected objects such as razors, towels, dishes, and other personal items.
How soon can I get tested for herpes 1 after exposure?
Our doctors recommend testing for herpes 1 virus 4-6 weeks after exposure. Herpes 1 antibodies can take from 2 weeks to 6 months to develop. Though herpes 1 is not a life threatening disease, our physicians recommend regular testing to avoid blindness that could result when herpes 1 infection moves from the mouth to the eye.
What do I need to do to prepare for a herpes 1 test?
No preparation or fasting is needed for herpes type 1 test.
See our Herpes 1 Testing Information.
What is herpes 2?
Herpes 2 (Genital Herpes) is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). Herpes 2 can be caused by Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) or Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2) but most genital herpes are caused by HSV-2. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 776,000 Americans are infected with the herpes 2 virus annually. 16.2% or 1 in 6 individuals aged 14-49 years have genital herpes infections making it one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the country.
How do you test for herpes 2?
STDcheck.com uses the CDC recommended and FDA-cleared type specific herpes 2 blood test. When you arrive at our {{ trans('global.center.full_name') }}, our technicians will draw a small amount of blood and you are done. Our herpes 2 test can differentiate between herpes 1 and herpes 2 and looks for antibodies to the herpes 2 in the blood.
How is herpes 2 transmitted?
Herpes 2 virus is transmitted through sexual intercourse. Having oral, vaginal or anal sex with someone infected with the herpes virus exposes you to the infection. Most people infected with herpes 2 do not show symptoms or experience very mild symptoms that are usually confused for other skin conditions. Transmission can occur even when no symptoms are visible.
How soon can I get tested for herpes 2 after exposure?
Although it is possible to test for herpes 2 virus three weeks after exposure, our doctors recommend testing 4-6 weeks after exposure to allow antibodies to develop in your system.
What do I need to do to prepare for a herpes 2 test?
There is nothing for you to do to prepare for the herpes 2 test. No fasting is required. Our testing center just needs a small sample of blood for herpes 2 test.
See our Herpes 2 Testing Information.
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV targets and destroys specific cells of the immune system called CD4 cells or T cells, making it hard for the body to fight common diseases. Unlike some other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), it is impossible to get rid of HIV. Once you have HIV infection, you have the disease for life. Doctors cannot cure the infection but antiretroviral therapies are available to control the disease. With proper medical care, someone diagnosed with HIV can live a normal life.
How do you test for HIV?
HIV 4th gen testing should list testing is looking for antibodies in the blood, and is conclusive by 97%-99% accuracy following 3 weeks exposure and 99% accurate following 12 weeks post-exposure.
How is HIV transmitted?
HIV is transmitted mainly through sexual intercourse. The virus is spread through blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum) and rectal fluids. It can also be transmitted from mother to infant through breast milk. Having unprotected sex with someone who has HIV exposes you to the disease. HIV infection risk is highest among those that engage in anal sex followed by vaginal sex and intravenous drug users who share needles with others.
How soon can I get tested for HIV after exposure?
It depends on whether you are taking the HIV Antibody test with Western Blot confirmation or the HIV RNA test. Wait at least 25 days to 2 months for HIV antibodies to develop in the blood before taking the HIV Antibody Test. If you want to take the HIV RNA test, wait 9-11 days before taking the test. Our FDA-approved HIV RNA test results are conclusive in 9-11 days after possible exposure.
What do I need to do to prepare for a HIV test?
You do not need to do anything or fast to prepare for our FDA-approved HIV antibody test with Western Blot exam or HIV RNA test.
See our HIV Testing information.
What is syphilis?
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by the Treponema pallidum bacterium. Syphilis can cause long-term complications and even death if not treated properly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports about 56,000 new syphilis infections annually in the United States, of which 13,970 are primary and secondary (P&S) infections . Syphilis symptoms can look like many other diseases and the infection progresses in stages if not treated early. The first
stage of syphilis is known as chancre which occurs on the genitals, vagina, anus or in the rectum. This chancre appears where the syphilis virus entered the body. Without treatment the person progresses to the second stage which begins with skin rashes and mucous membrane lesions or sores that are usually found in the mouth, vagina or anus. During the last and most dangerous latent stage, syphilis becomes asymptomatic (shows no symptoms) if the infected person does not receive treatment. This period lasts for years and could result in serious organ damage and even death.
How do you test for syphilis?
STDcheck.com tests for syphilis using the FDA-cleared Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test. This RPR
test looks for antibodies developed by the body to combat the syphilis virus. A confirmatory test is performed if the initial test comes back positive.
How is syphilis transmitted?
Syphilis is transmitted through direct contact with a syphilis sore which can be a chancre or a lesion on the body of an infected person. Chancres are usually present on external genitals, vagina, anus, or in the rectum of an infected person. They can also be found inside the mouth or on the lips. The easiest way to contract syphilis is by having unprotected vaginal, anal, and oral sex with an infected person. It can be transmitted by an infected mother to her baby during pregnancy.
How soon can I get tested for syphilis after exposure?
Our doctors recommend syphilis testing 3 - 6 weeks after possible exposure.
What do I need to do to prepare for a syphilis test?
No preparation or fasting is necessary to take the syphilis RPR test through STDcheck.com.
See our Syphilis Testing information.
When Is The Best Time To Test For STDs?
The best time to test for sexually transmitted diseases is now. The best way to test is with our comprehensive 10-Test Panel that checks for all of the most common STDs.

Signs & Symptoms for the Most Common STDs - STDcheck.com

STD Symptoms Overview
On This Page: Chlamydia | Gonorrhea | Herpes | HIV | Syphilis | Hepatitis
If you have sex or sexual contact—whether oral, vaginal, or anal— it’s possible to get a sexually transmitted disease (STD). STDs are very common. According to the Centers for Disease Control, millions of new cases happen each year in the United States, though many go undiagnosed.1
Many people don’t know they have an STD because many STDs don’t cause obvious symptoms. Often, people show no signs at all and may be unaware that they are infected for years. When signs appear, they can range from mild to severe and may be confused for other issues. This is why getting tested is important if you are sexually active.
Take Charge of Your Health
Getting tested is not only quick and easy, it’s the only way to know for sure if you do or do not have an STD.
or call 1-800-456-2323 or start a Live Chat
STDs can affect more than just the genitals—they can infect the mouth, throat, upper thighs, anus, and even the eyes.
Signs and symptoms of STDs vary depending on the disease, but can include:
No symptoms
Bumps, sores, or warts near the mouth, vagina, penis, or anus
Skin rash
Painful urination
Itching, irritation, or burning near the vagina or penis
Vaginal discharge in women
Discharge from the penis in men
Rectal discharge, bleeding, or pain
Vaginal odor
Redness or swelling near the genitals
Testicle pain and/or swelling in men
Painful sex
Lower abdominal pain
Flu-like symptoms like fever, body or muscle aches, and chills
Headache
Sore throat
Weight loss
Night sweats
Yellowing of the skin (jaundice)
Pink eye/conjunctivitis, or swollen and red eyes
Even if you’re not showing obvious signs, untreated STDs can harm your body. STDs are serious infections that can lead to health problems like pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, and organ damage. Some STDs—like HIV— can be deadly. What’s more, having an STD can pose dangers to your unborn baby if you’re pregnant, and put you at higher risk for acquiring HIV and other STDs.
Asymptomatic STDs
Many STDs show no signs or symptoms (asymptomatic). Even when you have no symptoms, you can pass the infection to sex partners. STDs can be spread from one person to another through contact with infected bodily fluids such as vaginal fluids, semen, or blood. They can also be spread through contact with infected mucous membranes (the moist, soft areas around openings to the body), or infected skin (like mouth sores).
It’s important to use protection like condoms or dental dams when you have sex, and to get tested regularly. Routine testing helps identify potential infections before they cause serious health issues or are spread to other sex partners.
Chlamydia Symptoms
Chlamydia is a common bacterial STD that can cause infections in the genitals, as well as the mouth, throat, anus, and even the eyes. Chlamydia often goes unnoticed because many people who have it experience no or few symptoms.
If you do develop noticeable signs, they may not appear until several weeks after you had sex with an infected partner. These signs and symptoms may be mild, making them easy to brush off. But even when signs are absent or easy to ignore, chlamydia damages your reproductive system.
Signs of chlamydia can include:2
Pain or burning when peeing
Discharge from the vagina or penis
Painful intercourse in women
Bleeding between periods in women
Painful or swollen testicles in men (less common)
Rectal pain, discharge, or bleeding
Gonorrhea Symptoms
Gonorrhea is an infection that’s also known as the clap or the drip. The bacteria can affect the genitals and other areas such as the mouth, throat, eyes, and anus. The initial signs and symptoms of gonorrhea generally appear within 2 weeks after infection, though it can take months. But many people with gonorrhea— including most women and many men— don’t show any signs or symptoms. 
When present, symptoms of gonorrhea include:3
Painful or burning sensation when urinating
Increased or abnormal vaginal discharge in women
White, yellow, or green discharge from the penis in men
Testicular pain or swelling in men (less common)
Rectal discharge or bleeding, or anal itching and soreness
Painful bowel movements
It’s common for people to have both chlamydia and gonorrhea in what’s called a coinfection.
Herpes Symptoms
The herpes simplex virus (HSV) is an infection that can occur in various parts of the body, most commonly the mouth (oral herpes) or the genitals (genital herpes). It can cause outbreaks of painful sores. However, most people with HSV don’t know they have it because they show no signs, or have symptoms so mild that may be overlooked. Signs of genital herpes are sometimes mistaken for pimples or ingrown hairs.
When symptoms appear, the first outbreak is usually the most severe. After it heals, some people don’t have any more outbreaks, while others have recurrent episodes for years.
When present, signs of oral herpes can include:4
Pain, burning, tingling, or itching before blisters appear
Cold sores or fever blisters in the mouth area, such as the lips, the gums, the tongue, inside of the cheek, the roof of the mouth, and the throat
Swollen lymph nodes
When noticeable, symptoms of genital herpes can include:5
Pain, burning, itching, or tenderness before blisters appear
Small red bumps or small white blisters, or open sores (ulcers) in, on, or around the genitals or anus, and nearby areas, such as the buttocks and thighs
Flu-like symptoms such as swollen lymph nodes in the groin, fever, headache, and muscle aches
Pain in the lower back, butt, and legs
Pain when peeing (when urine makes contact with sores)
Within a few weeks of becoming infected, some people experience initial symptoms of pain or itching in the affected area. After a few days, groups of small bumps or blisters can flare up. These blisters may break open, forming ulcers and leaking fluid. After scabs form, the ulcers heal over—but herpes can still be spread when sores aren’t present, and outbreaks may occur again in the future.
HIV Symptoms
HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. HIV attacks the immune system and weakens its ability to fight off infections and illnesses. HIV can lead to AIDS, a condition that can be life-threatening.
After contracting the virus, you may not have any symptoms right away. Some, but not all, people develop a flu-like illness between 2-4 weeks after being infected. 
Early HIV Signs
Early HIV symptoms can include:6
Fever
Rash
Headache
Fatigue
Sore throat
Swollen lymph nodes
These early signs of HIV usually go away within a few days or weeks, and they may be mistaken for something less serious. During early infection, the virus multiplies rapidly and a person is very contagious. After the initial symptoms disappear, a person with HIV may show no symptoms, and it can take years for more severe symptoms of HIV infection to develop.
As HIV multiplies and attacks the immune system, it becomes more difficult for the body to fight off infections. Certain illnesses may develop, and you may show signs of chronic infection, including:7
Swollen lymph nodes
Tiredness
Weight loss
Diarrhea
Mouth and skin problems
Cough
Fever
AIDS Signs
AIDS is the last stage of HIV infection when the immune system has been severely damaged. When someone has AIDS, they’re especially vulnerable to serious, potentially fatal illnesses and infections.
AIDS symptoms can include:
Recurring fever
Drenching night sweats
Rapid weight loss
Prolonged swelling of the lymph nodes
Persistent headaches
Extreme, unexplained fatigue
Chronic diarrhea
Discolored skin blotches
Sores on the mouth, genitals, or anus
Unusual illnesses from opportunistic diseases
Pneumonia
Memory loss, depression, or neurological disorder
Syphilis Symptoms
Syphilis is an STD caused by a type of bacteria. It affects the mucous membranes such as the genitals, as well as the skin, but it can be destructive for many parts of the body, including the brains, bones, and heart. Left untreated, late-stage syphilis can make you paralyzed, blind, numb, or demented.
Syphilis has four stages—primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. Each stage has its own associated symptoms. But recognizing syphilis can be tricky. Syphilis can go through periods when you don’t notice signs or symptoms. Even when signs of syphilis are present, they can be hard to distinguish from other conditions. Syphilis is called “The Great Pretender” because its symptoms can seem like many other diseases.
Syphilis can also pass from a pregnant mother to her unborn baby, which is called congenital syphilis. Congenital syphilis can cause debilitating health problems for a baby like deformed bones, and bone and nerve issues. It can also cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or infant death.
Primary Stage
The first sign of syphilis—usually a painless and highly contagious sore called a chancre—generally appears within 10 to 90 days.8 It occurs in the location where the syphilis bacteria entered the body, typically the genitals, rectum, or sometimes the lips or mouth. Single chancres are more common, though there may be multiple chancres. Sometimes, chancres can occur in hard-to-see areas like inside the vagina or rectum, making them hard to notice.
The sore heals on its own within 3-6 weeks. But without treatment, syphilis infection stays in the body and can spread through the bloodstream, progressing to the secondary stage.
Secondary Stage
Secondary syphilis tends to happen 2 to 8 weeks after a chancre has healed, or sometimes while it’s healing.9 It’s usually marked by a rash that can cover one or multiple parts of the body. Another common sign is lesions in the mouth and genitals. During this stage, a person is highly contagious.
Signs of secondary syphilis include:
Skin rash that’s usually non-itchy, and can occur on any part of the body, often the trunk, the palms, and the bottoms of the feet
Sores in the mouth, vagina, or anus
Fever
Swollen lymph glands
Tiredness and aches
Patchy hair loss
Symptoms may go away by themselves, without treatment. They may never return again, or they may repeatedly come and go over a long period.
Latent Stage
After secondary syphilis, some people may experience a period when no symptoms are present, called latent syphilis. Latent syphilis can last for months or even years. Signs may not ever come back, or secondary symptoms may appear again. Without treatment, latent syphilis may advance to the dangerous tertiary stage.
Tertiary Stage
Left untreated, syphilis may spread throughout the body. Tertiary syphilis can damage multiple organs systems such as the brain and nerves, the eyes, the bones and joints, the liver, and the eyes. It can appear 10-30 years after infection and is very serious.8 Tertiary syphilis can cause severe, disabling health issues and even death.
Effects of tertiary syphilis can include:
Numbness
Issues with movement
Paralysis
Vision problems or blindness
Mental decline, or dementia
Neurosyphilis
At any stage of infection, syphilis can spread to the nervous system, which controls your body and helps your body parts communicate. Often, neurosyphilis causes no symptoms, but it can lead to signs such as:
Headache
Trouble with coordination
Changes in behavior
Dementia
Hepatitis Symptoms
Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C are contagious viral infections that cause inflammation of the liver and liver damage. 
Many people don’t experience symptoms. For people who do, signs may appear several weeks after infection and include:10
Tiredness
Fever
Nausea and vomiting
Dark urine
Abdominal pain, especially in the upper right abdomen where the liver is located
Pale or clay-colored stool
Loss of appetite
Itching
Aching joints or muscles
Yellowed skin or eye whites (jaundice)
How Do You Know If You Have an STD?
You can’t always tell if you have an STD by how you look or feel, so thinking you or your partner(s) don’t have STDs is not the same as knowing for sure. If you think you have STD symptoms or are concerned you may have been exposed, getting tested is the best way to know your status. You can get tested at a doctor or clinic, or at a lab near you.
In general, it’s a good idea to get tested for STDs at least yearly. Early detection helps you protect yourself and get treatment if necessary. Some STDs are easily curable. Others can be managed with the right medication to lessen symptoms and reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.

More Information About Our Chlamydia Urine Test
Do you use blood or urine to test for chlamydia?
Chlamydia Urine Test
Our chlamydia test requires the lab to collect a urine sample. No blood is required for a chlamydia test.
Pricking, swabbing, and undressing will never be required for an NAA chlamydia test.
How do I prepare for a chlamydia urine Test?
You must avoid urinating for at least one hour before your chlamydia test. The sample must consist of first-catch
urine. First-catch urine is about 20-30mL of the initial urine stream. The sample should not consist of anything
more than first-catch urine, as this may dilute the sample.
Female test takers are encouraged to avoid cleansing the labial area before providing a sample.
No fasting is required. No other preparation is necessary.
When should I test for chlamydia?
If you’ve recently had an experience that you believe may have put you at risk of chlamydia, our doctors recommend
waiting at least 1-5 days post-exposure to be tested. At the very minimum, you should wait 24 hours after you may
have been exposed to chlamydia. For the most accurate possible results, you should get tested two weeks after
potential exposure.
If you have undergone chlamydia treatment, you should be tested again 21 to 28 days after treatment has ended to
verify that the bacterium has been eliminated.
If you have tested positive for gonorrhea, you should be tested for chlamydia. These infections often coincide,
and the symptoms are very similar.
How do I read my chlamydia test results?
If your chlamydia test results come back as positive, then the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis was found in your
system, and you do have chlamydia. If your results are negative, then you do not have chlamydia.
If you test too soon after exposure, your results may not be entirely accurate. Try and wait up to 2 weeks
post-potential exposure, to ensure the most accurate possible results.
Is there a chlamydia cure?
Chlamydia is entirely curable by treatment through antibiotics. If you test positive, you are eligible for an over-the-phone consultation with one of our doctors, who will be able to talk with you about treatment options. If need
be, antibiotics can be prescribed and picked up at your local pharmacy.
Who should be tested for chlamydia?
Both women and men are susceptible to chlamydia. The CDC states that there are almost 3 million new chlamydia
infections each year in the U.S.
Chlamydia is extremely common because it often shows no symptoms at all and is spread very easily. According to a
CDC report, “chlamydia prevalence among sexually active persons aged 14-24 years is nearly three times the
prevalence among those aged 25-39 years.”
The CDC strongly recommends testing for chlamydia in all sexually active women at the age of 25 or younger.
Chlamydia is considered more prevalent among young women, as the cervix is still in the developmental stages, and
is more susceptible to bacteria.
Regardless of age, if you have recently had unprotected sex with a partner whose STD status you are unaware of,
you should be tested for chlamydia.
When is the Right Time to Test For Chlamydia?
You should always know your sexual status. The best time to test for chlamydia is now.
If you feel that you have recently come into contact with chlamydia, you should wait a few days to be tested. It's
best to wait at least 1-5 days after potential chlamydia exposure, but two weeks is ideal.
You should be tested for chlamydia again at 21 to 28 days after you have completed treatment, to ensure that the
the bacterium is no longer found in your system.
If you have tested positive for gonorrhea, you should be tested for chlamydia as soon as possible. Chlamydia and
gonorrhea are widely known as co-existing infections. Having just one of these infections puts you at risk, or causes
you to be more susceptible to contracting the other. We recommend testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea at the same
time, which is why we offer the
chlamydia/gonorrhea test panel.
If you are not aware of your sexual status regarding any of the STDs including gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV-1, HIV-2,
Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HSV-1, or HSV-2 then our doctors strongly recommend the
10 Test Panel, which tests for all 10 of the most common STDs.
For any questions regarding which test you should take, or when you should be tested, reach out to a Care Advisor at
1-800-456-2323.

What is Gonorrhea? How do you get Gonorrhea | STDcheck.com

Gonorrhea
On This Page: Overview | Gonorrhea Symptoms | Causes | Risk Factors | Prevention 
What is Gonorrhea?
Gonorrhea is a bacterial sexually transmitted disease (STD) that is very common and easily cured with prescription antibiotics. It is spread through oral, vaginal, and anal sex. There are an estimated 820,000 cases of gonorrhea in the U.S. each year. Many people with gonorrhea are unaware they have it because they often have mild or no symptoms.1
Gonorrhea is often called “the drip” or “the clap” and is especially common in young people in their teens and twenties. It is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which infects the mucous membranes of the reproductive system including the cervix, fallopian tubes, uterus in women, and the urethra in both men and women. Gonorrhea can infect the penis, vagina, anus, throat, and (more rarely) eyes. If you don’t treat it, gonorrhea can lead to serious health problems or even infertility, which is why regular STD testing is important even if you feel healthy.
Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection that affects people’s reproductive systems, such as the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and urethra in women, and the urethra in men. It can also infect the throat and anus through oral or anal sex. Gonorrhea is spread through sexual contact with an infected person and can lead to serious health problems if not treated promptly.
Take Charge of Your Health
Untreated gonorrhea can lead to infertility​ in both men and women and make you more susceptible to contracting​ ​additional STDs​. Gonorrhea is an STD that is easily cured with antibiotics. Order quick and confidential testing today.

Symptoms of Gonorrhea
Many men and most women with gonorrhea have no symptoms at all. 
Symptoms in men include:
Painful urination
A white, yellow, or green discharge from the penis
Painful or swollen testicles
Symptoms in women include:
Pain or burning while urinating
Increased vaginal discharge
Vaginal bleeding between periods
In both men and women, rectal infections can cause no symptoms or cause symptoms such as anal discharge, soreness, bleeding, or itching, or painful bowel movements.
Read more link about gonorrhea symptoms and complications. 
Gonorrhea at other places in the body
How does gonorrhea affect your joints? –  Gonorrhea can affect the joints and cause a condition known as disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). DGI occurs when the bacteria that cause gonorrhea spread from the genital tract or rectum to other parts of the body, including the bloodstream. This can cause the bacteria to infect and inflame joints, leading to joint pain, swelling, and redness. In severe cases, DGI can lead to long-term joint damage and arthritis.
How does gonorrhea affect your rectum? – Gonorrhea can infect the rectum, causing rectal gonorrhea. This can occur through anal sex with an infected partner. Rectal gonorrhea can cause symptoms such as rectal pain, discharge, and bleeding. If left untreated, rectal gonorrhea can lead to serious health problems, including an increased risk of acquiring or transmitting other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), pelvic inflammatory disease, and infertility. It is important for individuals who engage in anal sex to get tested regularly for STIs, including gonorrhea, and to practice safe sex, such as using condoms, to reduce their risk of infection.
How does gonorrhea affect your eyes? – Gonorrhea can infect the eyes and cause a condition known as conjunctivitis or ophthalmia neonatorum. This occurs when the bacteria that cause gonorrhea spread from an infected person’s genital tract or rectum to the eyes. Conjunctivitis can cause symptoms such as redness, itching, burning, and discharge from the affected eye. In newborns, conjunctivitis can occur when the bacteria are transmitted during delivery and can lead to serious eye infections and even blindness if left untreated.
How Do You Get Gonorrhea?
Gonorrhea can be transmitted during oral, vaginal, and anal sex through the semen, pre-cum, or vaginal fluids of an infected partner; even if there is no ejaculation.
Gonorrhea can also be spread from mother to baby during childbirth.  A baby that contracts gonorrhea during childbirth may suffer blindness, joint infection, or a life-threatening blood infection. The CDC advises pregnant women to get tested and treated as necessary to prevent passing gonorrhea to the baby.
Who Is at Risk?
Anyone who is sexually active can get gonorrhea, especially if they are having unprotected sex. That being said, certain groups of people have biological and behavioral factors that put them at higher risk. According to the CDC, sexually active teenagers, young adults, and African Americans have the highest reported rates of infection.
The CDC recommends at least yearly gonorrhea screening for:2
Women under 25
Women older than 25 if they have risk factors like new or multiple sex partners or partners with an STD
Men who have sex with men
How Common is Gonorrhea
Gonorrhea is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) that affects millions of people worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 78 million people are infected with gonorrhea each year. The incidence of gonorrhea varies by region, with higher rates of infection reported in some countries and lower rates in others.
In the United States, gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported bacterial STI, with an estimated 635,000 new infections occurring each year. However, this number is likely an underestimate, as many people with gonorrhea do not show symptoms and therefore do not get tested and treated.
It is important to note that the incidence of gonorrhea can increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including access to sexual health education and resources, cultural attitudes towards STIs and sexual health, and the effectiveness of public health efforts to prevent the spread of STIs.
How Do You Prevent Gonorrhea?
Not having vaginal, anal, or oral sex is the best way to avoid gonorrhea. That being said, if you are sexually active, safer sex with consistent use of protection like latex or polyurethane condoms and dental dams helps lower (though not eliminate) the risk of getting an STD.
Being mutually monogamous with a long-term partner who has tested negative can also help prevent infection. Having open conversations about sexual health and getting regularly tested with your partner(s) can help confirm your status and protect your health.  We hope this helps answer the question “what is gonorrhea” and how it works.

Questions? Call 1-800-456-2323
What does “Value” mean?
Your STD test results may indicate “reactive,” “not-detected,” “non-reactive” or a reference range. Not detected and non-reactive mean the STD was not detected in your system. The reference range indicates whether the STD value is high enough to be considered positive; if not, it returns negative. For example, a range of < 0.90 in the “Herpes Simplex-2” test means any results below the 0.90 range are considered negative.
Can I speak with a doctor if I am positive?
If your test results are positive for any STD, you can discuss your results, ask questions, and get guidance during a phone consultation with one of our doctors. You may also be advised to seek additional testing or explore treatment options depending on the STD you’ve contracted.
What does “Result” mean?
Your “result” is the outcome of your test. Depending on a number of factors, including whether an STD was found in your system, your result will either be positive or negative.
Can I get the same STD a second time?
Yes. You can be infected with the same STD more than once if you continue having unprotected sex with an infected partner. Failing to complete your entire course of prescribed medication will also make you vulnerable to re-infection. It is also possible to be infected with more than one STD at a time. For instance, having HIV makes it easier to become infected with other STDs.
